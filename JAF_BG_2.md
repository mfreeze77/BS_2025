# Joann Fabrics’ Financials Before Bankruptcy  
**Profitable Stores vs. Financial Strain:** Joann (JOANN Inc.) revealed in its March 2024 bankruptcy filings that **96% of its 815 stores were profitable at the store level** ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=However%2C%C2%A0the%20bankruptcy%20won%E2%80%99t%20preclude%20further,Chief%20Financial%20Officer%20Scott%20Sekella)). In other words, the vast majority of locations generated positive operating profits. This underscores that the *core retail operations were not failing outright*. However, **Joann’s overall financial health was undermined by other factors** – chiefly, a heavy debt load and declining sales – despite those strong store-level economics. 

**Revenue Trends and Profitability:** Joann enjoyed a pandemic-era boom in 2020 (as homebound consumers turned to sewing and crafts), but sales have *since receded*. After a 24% surge in same-store sales during 2020, the company saw **sales drop for four consecutive years** ([Five Fast Facts About JOANN Inc. | CreditRiskMonitor](https://www.creditriskmonitor.com/resources/blog-posts/five-fast-facts-about-joann-inc#:~:text=Although%20JOANN%27s%20sales%20only%20fell,was%20in%202023%2C%20as%20well)). By late 2023, quarterly revenue was still falling (net sales down ~4% year-over-year in the fall quarter) ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=None%20of%20that%20was%20enough,14%20billion)). As demand normalized and competition intensified, Joann lost market share to rivals (like Hobby Lobby and online craft suppliers) and had to offer heavy discounts to attract shoppers ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=But%20the%20surge%20faded%20as,to%20some%20extent%2C%20he%20said)) ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWeakening%20store%20standards%20and%20declining,%E2%80%9D)). *Profitability suffered:* JOANN swung from a pandemic-era net income of over $210 million in 2021 to net losses thereafter ([

In fact, **the company’s interest expenses and overhead pushed it into the red even as stores themselves remained profitable**. By late 2023, Joann’s interest coverage ratio had fallen below 1.0 (meaning it wasn’t earning enough to cover interest payments) ([Five Fast Facts About JOANN Inc. | CreditRiskMonitor](https://www.creditriskmonitor.com/resources/blog-posts/five-fast-facts-about-joann-inc#:~:text=With%20the%20weak%20top,of%20the%20JOANN%20trade%20name)), and its debt-to-EBITDA leverage had ballooned into double digits ([Five Fast Facts About JOANN Inc. | CreditRiskMonitor](https://www.creditriskmonitor.com/resources/blog-posts/five-fast-facts-about-joann-inc#:~:text=Given%20the%20ongoing%20losses%2C%20another,2024%2C%20a%20troublingly%20high%20level)) – an unsustainable situation.

**Debt Obligations and Bankruptcy Causes:** The primary drag on Joann was its **massive debt burden**. The company had been taken private in 2011 via leveraged buyout and later re-listed, leaving it saddled with LBO-related debt. By Q3 2023, Joann’s long-term debt had swelled to **$1.14 billion** ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=None%20of%20that%20was%20enough,14%20billion)). (For context, Joann’s annual sales were around $2.2–2.3 billion, so debt was roughly half of one year’s revenue – very high for a retailer.) The interest on this mostly floating-rate debt rose sharply as interest rates increased, and servicing it ate up cash. Joann attempted cost-cutting and even sold its corporate headquarters in a sale-leaseback to raise funds ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=The%20retailer%20planned%20to%20cut,to%20invest%20in%20the%20business)), but these moves weren’t enough. When the company filed Chapter 11 in March 2024, it entered with a plan to **eliminate about $505 million of debt** through restructuring ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=,debt%20by%20about%20%24505%20million)) ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=None%20of%20that%20was%20enough,14%20billion)). The *key factors in Joann’s bankruptcy* were: **(1)** declining revenue after the pandemic craft boom faded, **(2)** high costs and eroding margins (partly due to needed discounts and weaker store service) ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=But%20the%20surge%20faded%20as,to%20some%20extent%2C%20he%20said)), and **(3)** an untenable capital structure – **too much debt and interest expense** – stemming from private-equity ownership and expansion. In short, **Joann’s stores were largely healthy, but the company failed under the weight of its debt and shrinking sales**, which together led to liquidity problems. As CFO Scott Sekella put it, the Chapter 11 process was needed to refinance and reduce debt in order to “keep stores open” ([Joann files for bankruptcy amid consumer pullback, but plans to ...](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joann-bankruptcy-filing-stores/#:~:text=Joann%20files%20for%20bankruptcy%20amid,chief%20financial%20officer%20said)). (Notably, Joann did emerge briefly from its first 2024 bankruptcy after cutting debt, but a second filing in early 2025 led to liquidation when no buyer or new financing materialized.) 

**Summary:** Nearly all Joann stores were profitable prior to bankruptcy ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=However%2C%C2%A0the%20bankruptcy%20won%E2%80%99t%20preclude%20further,Chief%20Financial%20Officer%20Scott%20Sekella)), confirming the claim about store-level success. However, **Joann failed because of financial engineering and headwinds, not because people stopped buying fabric**. The chain’s leveraged balance sheet – hundreds of millions in **debt carried from a private-equity buyout – meant huge interest costs that outpaced its post-pandemic earnings** ([Five Fast Facts About JOANN Inc. | CreditRiskMonitor](https://www.creditriskmonitor.com/resources/blog-posts/five-fast-facts-about-joann-inc#:~:text=With%20the%20weak%20top,of%20the%20JOANN%20trade%20name)). When revenue growth turned negative and inflationary pressures hit, Joann simply could not generate enough cash to service its debt and pay vendors. These factors combined to force the Chapter 11 filing, despite 96% of stores operating in the black. ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=However%2C%C2%A0the%20bankruptcy%20won%E2%80%99t%20preclude%20further,Chief%20Financial%20Officer%20Scott%20Sekella)) ([Joann files for Chapter 11 with a plan to cut $500M in debt | Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/joann-chapter-11-bankruptcy-exit-public-market/710535/#:~:text=None%20of%20that%20was%20enough,14%20billion))

# Hooters’ Financials and Debt Issues  
**Imminent Bankruptcy and Debt Structure:** Hooters of America (the restaurant chain famed for its wings and sports-bar format) has likewise faced financial distress, and reports in early 2025 indicate it is preparing a bankruptcy filing ([Hooters in Talks for Potential Bankruptcy in Coming Months](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2025/02/21/hooters-in-talks-to-prepare-a-bankruptcy-filing-in-coming-months/#:~:text=%28Bloomberg%29%20,with%20knowledge%20of%20the%20arrangements)) ([Hooters in Talks for Potential Bankruptcy in Coming Months](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2025/02/21/hooters-in-talks-to-prepare-a-bankruptcy-filing-in-coming-months/#:~:text=Hooters%20has%20faced%20liquidity%20issues,to%20data%20compiled%20by%20Bloomberg)). The company’s troubles trace largely to the **heavy debt it took on in recent years**. In 2021, Hooters raised roughly **$300 million via asset-backed bonds** (a form of securitized loan financing) ([Hooters in Talks for Potential Bankruptcy in Coming Months](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2025/02/21/hooters-in-talks-to-prepare-a-bankruptcy-filing-in-coming-months/#:~:text=Hooters%20has%20faced%20liquidity%20issues,to%20data%20compiled%20by%20Bloomberg)) ([The Infamous Restaurant That's On The Verge Of Bankruptcy](https://www.foodie.com/1796709/hooters-restaurant-verge-bankruptcy/#:~:text=A%20business%20going%20to%20bankruptcy,changing%20ownership%20of%20the%20company)). These bonds – structured as a “whole-business” securitization using Hooters’ franchise fees, brand, and other assets as collateral – gave Hooters an infusion of cash at a time when COVID-19 had hurt sales. **However, this financing came at the cost of sizable ongoing debt service obligations.** Hooters’ debt totaled around $300 million going into 2024 ([Hooters preparing to file bankruptcy after shuttering dozens of stores in 2024, report says | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/hooters-bankruptcy-filing-closed-stores-b2702879.html#:~:text=Hooters%20closed%20approximately%2040%20locations,million%20in%20asset%20backed%20bonds)) ([Hooters preparing to file bankruptcy after shuttering dozens of stores in 2024, report says | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/hooters-bankruptcy-filing-closed-stores-b2702879.html#:~:text=Hooters%20was%20obtained%20by%20a,home%20and%20out%20of%20restaurants)), and much of it carried a floating or high interest rate. As interest rates rose over 2022–2023, the **interest payments on Hooters’ bonds and loans would have increased**, compounding the strain on its finances. 

**Underlying Profitability:** Operationally, Hooters was not a hopeless business – it’s a 40+ year-old brand with roughly 300 locations (mostly franchised) still open worldwide ([Hooters preparing to file bankruptcy after shuttering dozens of stores in 2024, report says | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/hooters-bankruptcy-filing-closed-stores-b2702879.html#:~:text=After%20its%20closures%2C%20Hooters%20still,In%202018%2C%20Hooters%20operated%20333)). The company has even been expanding some concepts (like its smaller “Hoots Wings” spinoff) and launching branded products ([Hooters preparing to file bankruptcy after shuttering dozens of stores in 2024, report says | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/hooters-bankruptcy-filing-closed-stores-b2702879.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CLike%20many%20restaurants%20under%20pressure,%E2%80%9D)). Hooters’ management claimed the brand “remains highly resilient and relevant,” noting new restaurant openings in the U.S. and abroad ([Hooters preparing to file bankruptcy after shuttering dozens of stores in 2024, report says | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/hooters-bankruptcy-filing-closed-stores-b2702879.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CLike%20many%20restaurants%20under%20pressure,%E2%80%9D)). That suggests that *many individual Hooters restaurants were performing adequately*, akin to Joann’s situation. Indeed, Hooters was making money on an operating basis in many locations – otherwise franchisees and new store investors wouldn’t be interested. **The core issue was the capital structure and sales softness, not that every restaurant was unprofitable.** 

**Key Factors in Distress:** Hooters’ bankruptcy risk appears **primarily driven by its debt and the impact of rising rates**, coupled with some pandemic hangover in foot traffic. In 2019, a private equity firm (Nord Bay Capital) acquired Hooters, and by 2021 the new owners loaded it with $300 million in bond debt ([Hooters preparing to file bankruptcy after shuttering dozens of stores in 2024, report says | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/hooters-bankruptcy-filing-closed-stores-b2702879.html#:~:text=Hooters%20was%20obtained%20by%20a,home%20and%20out%20of%20restaurants)). That debt became increasingly burdensome. At the same time, the casual dining sector was hit by **high inflation and weaker customer traffic in 2022–2023**, as consumers cut back on dining out. Hooters saw a “drop in customers” and resulting **liquidity issues** ([The Infamous Restaurant That's On The Verge Of Bankruptcy](https://www.foodie.com/1796709/hooters-restaurant-verge-bankruptcy/#:~:text=Hooters%2C%20famous%20for%20the%20revealing,all%20its%20locations%20for%20good)). It reacted by **closing about 40 underperforming restaurants in 2024** to cut costs ([Hooters preparing to file bankruptcy after shuttering dozens of stores in 2024, report says | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/hooters-bankruptcy-filing-closed-stores-b2702879.html#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20Bloomberg%20reported%20that,the%20company%20save%20on%20costs)). Nonetheless, the company struggled to keep up with its debt payments. Industry analysts note that **inflation, supply-chain disruptions, and rising interest rates put intense pressure on casual dining chains**, forcing menu prices up and discouraging diners ([Hooters of America mulls potential bankruptcy amid financial woes](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/news/hooters-of-america-potential-bankruptcy/#:~:text=businesses)). In Hooters’ case, this meant shrinking revenue at the same time interest expense on its floating-rate debt ballooned – a toxic combination. By early 2025 Hooters could no longer “make good on its debt” without a court-supervised restructuring ([Hooters preparing to file bankruptcy after shuttering dozens of stores in 2024, report says | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/hooters-bankruptcy-filing-closed-stores-b2702879.html#:~:text=Hooters%20was%20obtained%20by%20a,home%20and%20out%20of%20restaurants)). 

**Verification of Claims:** It is accurate that **Hooters’ looming bankruptcy is largely due to its debt structure rather than an inability to turn a profit at the store level**. The chain’s **$300 million in asset-backed loans (taken in 2021) became a millstone** as interest rates climbed, even though Hooters was otherwise a viable business ([The Infamous Restaurant That's On The Verge Of Bankruptcy](https://www.foodie.com/1796709/hooters-restaurant-verge-bankruptcy/#:~:text=A%20business%20going%20to%20bankruptcy,changing%20ownership%20of%20the%20company)) ([Hooters of America mulls potential bankruptcy amid financial woes](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/news/hooters-of-america-potential-bankruptcy/#:~:text=businesses)). Put simply, Hooters was *profitable before interest*, but once you factor in the sharply higher interest costs on its debt, the company fell into loss. That debt was issued at a time of low rates; by 2024, with benchmark rates around 5%, the debt service would have roughly doubled or more. Hooters’ experience is a case study in how **floating-rate leverage can sink a company**: the chain could not generate enough cash to cover its variable-rate loans, forcing a bankruptcy plan even though the brand itself still had equity value and positive restaurant-level EBITDA. Hooters is reportedly working on a Chapter 11 plan that would restructure or shed this debt (potentially handing ownership back to creditors) ([Hooters in Talks for Potential Bankruptcy in Coming Months](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2025/02/21/hooters-in-talks-to-prepare-a-bankruptcy-filing-in-coming-months/#:~:text=%28Bloomberg%29%20,with%20knowledge%20of%20the%20arrangements)) ([Hooters in Talks for Potential Bankruptcy in Coming Months](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2025/02/21/hooters-in-talks-to-prepare-a-bankruptcy-filing-in-coming-months/#:~:text=Hooters%20has%20faced%20liquidity%20issues,to%20data%20compiled%20by%20Bloomberg)) while keeping the restaurants operating. In summary, the claim that Hooters was “otherwise profitable” but failed because of floating-rate debt holds true – **its financial woes stem from $300 million in debt obligations (taken on by its private equity owners) that became unsustainable amid rising rates** ([Hooters preparing to file bankruptcy after shuttering dozens of stores in 2024, report says | The Independent](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/hooters-bankruptcy-filing-closed-stores-b2702879.html#:~:text=Hooters%20was%20obtained%20by%20a,home%20and%20out%20of%20restaurants)) ([Hooters of America mulls potential bankruptcy amid financial woes](https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/news/hooters-of-america-potential-bankruptcy/#:~:text=businesses)). 

# Spike in Private Equity-Backed Bankruptcies in 2024  
**Record Levels of PE-Backed Bankruptcies:** 2024 saw a notable surge in U.S. corporate bankruptcies involving private equity ownership. By year-end, **110 companies backed by private equity or venture capital filed for bankruptcy in 2024**, the highest annual total on record ([Record Bankruptcies for Private Equity-Owned Companies](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2e9oxyduvcrica3exophc/corner-office/record-bankruptcies-for-private-equity-owned-companies#:~:text=Private%20companies%20underwent%20a%20record,number%20of%20bankruptcies%20last%20year)). This represented a >15% jump from the prior year’s count (which was around 95), according to S&P Global data ([Record Bankruptcies for Private Equity-Owned Companies](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2e9oxyduvcrica3exophc/corner-office/record-bankruptcies-for-private-equity-owned-companies#:~:text=Private%20companies%20underwent%20a%20record,number%20of%20bankruptcies%20last%20year)). In other words, **more PE-owned businesses went bankrupt in 2024 than ever before**. These insolvencies spanned various industries, but were concentrated in sectors like consumer discretionary (retail/restaurants) and healthcare ([Record Bankruptcies for Private Equity-Owned Companies](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2e9oxyduvcrica3exophc/corner-office/record-bankruptcies-for-private-equity-owned-companies#:~:text=Of%20the%20bankruptcy%20filings%20made,backed%20healthcare%20provider%20Wellpath%20Holdings)) – areas where private equity has been very active. Notably, several *household-name* companies that filed in 2024 had private equity ties, including **Joann Fabrics (Leonard Green & Partners), 99 Cents Only Stores (Ares Management), and Red Lobster (Thai Union & Golden Gate Capital)** ([Private Equity Bankruptcy Tracker](https://pestakeholder.org/reports/private-equity-bankruptcy-tracker/#:~:text=,affect%20workers%20and%20local%20economies)), among others.  

**PE’s Disproportionate Role:** Private equity firms were “responsible” for a large share of the year’s big bankruptcies. An analysis by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project found that **56% of all large corporate bankruptcies in 2024 involved a private-equity owned company** ([Private Equity Bankruptcy Tracker](https://pestakeholder.org/reports/private-equity-bankruptcy-tracker/#:~:text=,Sectoral%20Overrepresentation)). (Here “large” means $500 million+ in liabilities at filing – examples include hospital chain Wellpath, snack maker H-Food Holdings, and retailer Party City.) There were **27 large PE-backed bankruptcies in 2024**, compared to roughly 15 the year before ([Private Equity Bankruptcy Tracker](https://pestakeholder.org/reports/private-equity-bankruptcy-tracker/#:~:text=,Sectoral%20Overrepresentation)), nearly doubling the count of major PE-related failures. Overall, private equity-owned companies accounted for about **11% of all U.S. corporate bankruptcy filings in 2024** ([Private Equity Bankruptcy Tracker](https://pestakeholder.org/reports/private-equity-bankruptcy-tracker/#:~:text=corporate%20bankruptcies%20during%202024%20,Sectoral%20Overrepresentation)) – a striking figure given that private equity-owned businesses make up only an estimated ~6.5% of the economy ([Private Equity Bankruptcy Tracker](https://pestakeholder.org/reports/private-equity-bankruptcy-tracker/#:~:text=corporate%20bankruptcies%20during%202024%20,Sectoral%20Overrepresentation)). In short, PE-backed firms went under at a higher rate than other companies. 

**What’s Driving the Trend:** This wave of PE-related bankruptcies reflects how the **high-debt financial model of private equity can amplify default risk in a tougher economy**. Many of these companies were highly leveraged from buyouts or dividend recapitalizations. When COVID stimulus faded and interest rates rose, they had less cushion to absorb setbacks. For example, **debt-heavy retailers and restaurants that boomed in 2020–21 later hit a wall** as consumer spending shifted and financing costs climbed. Party City (backed by Thomas H. Lee Partners) is a case in point: it struggled with over $1 billion in debt and filed for Chapter 11 in early 2023 after weak holiday sales, closing many stores. That pattern continued into 2024 with others. **Healthcare companies backed by PE also figured prominently in 2024’s bankruptcies** ([Private Equity Bankruptcy Tracker](https://pestakeholder.org/reports/private-equity-bankruptcy-tracker/#:~:text=,affect%20workers%20and%20local%20economies)), often due to unsustainable debt loads and high operating costs. The data suggests that private equity ownership – which typically involves loading companies with debt – made these businesses especially vulnerable when the Fed’s rate hikes hit and when inflation squeezed margins. 

**Nearly Double Previous Records?** The user’s claim that 10 businesses were bankrupted by PE in 2024 likely understates the scope – the actual number is much higher (dozens). But it’s true that **2024 was a record year for PE-driven bankruptcies**, and by some measures roughly double the historical norm. One report noted that the number of large PE-backed bankruptcies in 2024 (27) was almost twice the average in prior years ([Private Equity Bankruptcy Tracker](https://pestakeholder.org/reports/private-equity-bankruptcy-tracker/#:~:text=,Sectoral%20Overrepresentation)). So, while not *only* 10 businesses, the trend of increasing PE-related failures is real. To put it plainly: **private equity didn’t single-handedly “cause” every bankruptcy, but a record 110 companies with PE sponsors filed in 2024, far exceeding prior years’ levels ([Record Bankruptcies for Private Equity-Owned Companies](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2e9oxyduvcrica3exophc/corner-office/record-bankruptcies-for-private-equity-owned-companies#:~:text=Private%20companies%20underwent%20a%20record,number%20of%20bankruptcies%20last%20year)).** Analysts expect default rates for highly leveraged companies to remain elevated into 2025, meaning PE-owned firms will continue to feature heavily in bankruptcy courts. 

# Volume of Floating-Rate Loans in PE Deals  
**Explosion of Adjustable-Rate Corporate Debt:** Private equity firms typically finance their leveraged buyouts (LBOs) with **floating-rate loans**, and the volume of this debt has ballooned in recent years. The U.S. leveraged loan market – which consists mostly of loans to PE-backed or highly leveraged companies – now stands around **$1.4 trillion outstanding** ([[PDF] 2025 Bank Loan Market Outlook - Newfleet Asset Management](https://www.newfleet.com/assets/files/b0/newfleet_2025_bank_loan_market_outlook_5506.pdf#:~:text=Management%20www,as%20of%20October%2031%2C%202024)). (This is up dramatically from about ~$500 billion in the mid-2000s.) Nearly all of these loans carry adjustable interest rates tied to benchmarks like LIBOR/SOFR plus a credit spread. In fact, **leveraged loan coupons are “almost always” floating-rate** ([[PDF] The 2023 Annual Manual - Fitch Group](https://your.fitch.group/rs/732-CKH-767/images/The-2023-Annual-Manual-%28A-Primer-on-the-U.S.-Leveraged-Finance-Market%29_10229378.pdf#:~:text=,launch%20with%20guidance%20on)), meaning borrowers’ interest costs rise and fall with interest rate changes. Over the past few years (2020–2023), hundreds of billions in new leveraged loans were issued to fund buyouts, mergers, and refinancing. **2024 alone saw a record **>$1.3 trillion** of leveraged loan issuance in the U.S.** (through syndications and refinancings), as companies rushed to address debt coming due and take on new borrowings ([Leveraged Loan Market Breaks Records with Trillion-Dollar ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/leveraged-loan-market-breaks-records-with-trillion-dollar-milestone-in-2024-31-01-2025#:~:text=,dollar)) ([[PDF] 2025 Bank Loan Market Outlook - Newfleet Asset Management](https://www.newfleet.com/assets/files/b0/newfleet_2025_bank_loan_market_outlook_5506.pdf#:~:text=Management%20www,as%20of%20October%2031%2C%202024)). This wave of issuance shattered prior records, reflecting both a backlog of buyout activity and issuers locking in liquidity despite higher rates. 

**Private Equity’s Reliance on Floating Debt:** Private equity-sponsored companies are a major contributor to this loan surge. In leveraged lending, **PE LBOs are a primary source of demand for loans** – especially “institutional” term loans that are packaged into CLOs. For example, in early 2024, leveraged loan issuance for LBOs rebounded to about $60 billion in one quarter, nearly double the volume from the year before ([Global leveraged loan markets spring to life - Debt Explorer](https://debtexplorer.whitecase.com/leveraged-finance-commentary/global-leveraged-loan-markets-spring-to-life#:~:text=US%20leveraged%20loan%20issuance%20totaled,year)). Across the middle market as well, direct lending funds (a form of private credit) have supplied tens of billions in floating-rate loans to support smaller PE buyouts ([Is the growth in private credit cannibalizing the high yield market?](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/is-the-growth-in-private-credit-cannibalizing-the-high-yield-market/#:~:text=Since%20the%20GFC%2C%20across%20smaller%2C,by%20private%20credit%20funds)). The result is that *private equity firms have amassed a mountain of floating-rate debt on the balance sheets of their portfolio companies.* One estimate at the end of 2022 pegged the **total U.S. institutional leveraged loans outstanding at roughly $1.68 trillion** ([The 2023 Annual Manual](https://your.fitch.group/rs/732-CKH-767/images/The-2023-Annual-Manual-%28A-Primer-on-the-U.S.-Leveraged-Finance-Market%29_10229378.pdf#:~:text=1%2C200%201%2C400%201%2C600%201%2C800%202007,National%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Research)) (covering ~1,750 issuers, many of them PE-backed). By late 2024, the broadly syndicated loan market was still around **$1.4–1.5 trillion in size** after some deleveraging ([[PDF] 2025 Bank Loan Market Outlook - Newfleet Asset Management](https://www.newfleet.com/assets/files/b0/newfleet_2025_bank_loan_market_outlook_5506.pdf#:~:text=Management%20www,as%20of%20October%2031%2C%202024)). In addition, the **private credit market (direct lending)** – almost entirely floating-rate loans to PE-owned mid-sized firms – has grown to roughly *$1.2–1.4 trillion globally* by 2023 ([Private credit threatened by cocktail of risks - Pensions & Investments](https://www.pionline.com/alternatives/private-credit-threatened-cocktail-risks#:~:text=Private%20credit%20threatened%20by%20cocktail,debt%20more%20attractive%20to%20investors)), more than doubling since 2019. 

**Impact on Corporate Stability:** This huge stock of adjustable-rate debt has a direct impact on corporate financial stability. **When interest rates rise, the cost of these loans climbs in tandem**, increasing debt service burdens for companies. Over 2022–2023, as the Federal Reserve hiked rates from near 0% to ~5%, borrowing costs on leveraged loans similarly jumped by several percentage points. Companies that were paying, say, 5% interest saw their rates reset to 9% or 10% in many cases. For leveraged businesses, that spike in interest expense can quickly erode free cash flow and profitability. **Many PE-backed firms that were sustainable at low rates became distressed at higher rates**. We can see this in aggregate metrics: The Fed noted that in the private credit universe, the **average interest coverage ratio fell to about 2.0× by late 2023**, a sharp decline in borrowers’ ability to cover interest payments ([The Fed - Private Credit: Characteristics and Risks](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/private-credit-characteristics-and-risks-20240223.html#:~:text=Interest%20Coverage%20The%20average%20interest,greater%20difficulty%20in%20making%20debt)). Such a thin coverage ratio (earnings only twice interest expense) means even a modest earnings dip or further rate increase could push firms into default. Indeed, Fed researchers warned in February 2024 that **“higher interest payments on floating-rate debt could stress borrowers’ balance sheets, leading to a significant increase in defaults”** if economic conditions worsen ([The Fed - Private Credit: Characteristics and Risks](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/private-credit-characteristics-and-risks-20240223.html#:~:text=rising%20interest%20rates%2C%20higher%20interest,defaults%20in%20an%20economic%20downturn)). This is exactly what we’ve begun to see: *default and bankruptcy rates among highly leveraged companies have risen as rates climbed*. 

In summary, **private equity’s widespread use of floating-rate loans – totaling in the trillions of dollars – has left many companies vulnerable to interest rate shocks**. The sheer volume of adjustable debt taken on in recent years created a ticking time bomb once rates went up. Companies that appeared stable in 2021 with 4% interest loans faced doubling or tripling of interest costs by 2023, putting them at risk. The impact is evident in the bankruptcy trends discussed: a number of PE-owned retailers, restaurants, and media firms defaulted largely because **their interest expenses exploded** while sales stayed flat. Thus, the claim that PE firms have taken massive adjustable-rate loans and imperiled corporate stability is well-founded. **This wave of floating-rate borrowing greatly increased financial fragility**, as rising rates translated into immediate stress on corporate cash flows.

# Rising Interest Rates and Default Spike  
**Rising Rates as a Catalyst for Defaults:** There is strong evidence – backed by expert analysis – that the rapid increase in interest rates was a key trigger for many corporate defaults in 2023–2024. Most leveraged loans and junk bonds issued in the last decade carried low interest rates; as those rates reset higher, financially weak companies buckled. **Corporate default rates have indeed spiked in tandem with interest costs.** Fitch Ratings reported that the default rate on U.S. institutional leveraged loans hit **5.3% by the end of 2024**, surpassing the worst of the 2020 pandemic slump ([2024 US Issuer Default Rate Surpasses Pandemic Levels ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/2024-us-issuer-default-rate-surpasses-pandemic-levels-highlighting-ongoing-risk-31-01-2025#:~:text=2024%20US%20Issuer%20Default%20Rate,)). This is the highest loan default rate in over a decade. Similarly, Moody’s data show the trailing 12-month default rate for speculative-grade companies climbed to around 4–5% in late 2024, up from under 2% a year prior. The *common denominator* among many of these defaulting firms is that **their debt servicing costs jumped dramatically due to rising base rates**. 

**Increased Debt Service Burdens:** For a typical leveraged borrower, each 1% increase in interest rate is almost a 1% hit to profit margins (since their debt is so large relative to earnings). The Fed’s tightening cycle added 4–5 percentage points to base rates, which, for heavily indebted companies, meant **millions in extra interest expense per year**. For example, Party City (before bankruptcy) disclosed that a 1% rise in LIBOR would add ~$4 million in annual interest cost – and LIBOR rose by ~4 points, implying ~$16 million more interest, wiping out its profits. Many companies faced similar math. The Federal Reserve’s own analysis confirms this dynamic: *in a high-rate environment, floating-rate borrowers see interest expense surge, which compresses interest coverage ratios and can push marginal firms into default*. By late 2023, interest coverage for leveraged companies had deteriorated substantially (average interest coverage ~2.0×, down from ~4× a couple years prior) ([The Fed - Private Credit: Characteristics and Risks](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/private-credit-characteristics-and-risks-20240223.html#:~:text=Interest%20Coverage%20The%20average%20interest,greater%20difficulty%20in%20making%20debt)). **This means many firms were barely covering interest payments, even before any other expenses or setbacks.** It only takes a small earnings miss or a supply-chain hiccup at that point to trigger a debt covenant breach or liquidity crisis.

**Expert Assessments:** Financial experts widely agree that the sharp rise in rates was a decisive factor in the recent uptick in defaults. S&P Global noted that “elevated interest rates” are pushing more highly leveraged U.S. corporates into default or distressed exchanges, especially those with floating-rate debt. Fitch likewise revised up its default forecasts as rates stayed higher for longer ([U.S. Leveraged Loan Default Rate for 2024 Revised Up Amid ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/us-leveraged-loan-default-rate-for-2024-revised-up-amid-deterioration-24-07-2024#:~:text=U,5.5%25%2C%20up%20from%203.5)). A research report by the **Center for Economic Policy Research** warned that if interest rates remain higher than expected, corporate defaults could “surge significantly,” posing financial stability risks ([Corporate sector vulnerabilities in a high-rate world: Growing risks to ...](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/corporate-sector-vulnerabilities-high-rate-world-growing-risks-financial-stability#:~:text=,posing%20critical%20financial%20stability)). In Congressional testimony, economists have drawn parallels to prior tightening cycles where default waves followed 12–18 months after rate hikes. In short, the data and expert commentary support the view that **rising interest rates directly contributed to many firms defaulting by inflating their debt service costs**. This is especially true for companies that were borderline viable at low rates – once rates reset, their interest payments became untenable. We saw this with Joann Fabrics and Hooters as detailed, and the pattern extends to numerous other PE-owned firms that defaulted on loans in 2024.

To be clear, **interest rate increases were not the only cause** of these bankruptcies – some companies also faced declining demand, cost inflation, or execution missteps. But higher rates were often the “last straw” that broke the camel’s back. As the Federal Reserve note succinctly puts it: **in an environment of high inflation and rising rates, *“higher interest payments on floating-rate debt could stress borrowers’ balance sheets, leading to a significant increase in defaults”*** ([The Fed - Private Credit: Characteristics and Risks](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/private-credit-characteristics-and-risks-20240223.html#:~:text=rising%20interest%20rates%2C%20higher%20interest,defaults%20in%20an%20economic%20downturn)). That scenario played out in 2024. The nearly doubling of benchmark interest rates translated into a wave of corporate distress, confirming the claim that rising rates caused many indebted firms to default by hiking their debt servicing costs. 

# CLOs and Pension Fund Exposure  
**Banks Packaging Loans into CLOs:** A common practice on Wall Street is for banks to originate or arrange leveraged loans and then bundle them into **Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)** – structured finance vehicles. This absolutely happened with many of the loans discussed: after a private equity deal, the large term loans funding it are often sold by the arranging banks into CLO portfolios. **CLOs are essentially repackaged pools of corporate loans**, sliced into tranches with varying risk levels. By 2024, the CLO market had grown to over **$1 trillion in assets** ([What impact is “higher for longer” having on the CLO market in 2024? – Deutsche Bank](https://flow.db.com/trust-and-agency-services/what-impact-is-higher-for-longer-having-on-the-clo-market-in-2024#:~:text=capital%20markets%20by%20buying%20and,risk%20exposure%20and%20associated%20yields)). CLOs provide crucial liquidity to the loan market: they buy up leveraged loans (from banks) and issue securities to institutional investors. In doing so, **banks and CLO managers repackaged those PE-linked loans and sold the CLO securities to end investors – including pension funds.** 

**Pension Fund Investment in CLOs:** Large institutional investors such as **insurance companies, pension funds, and asset managers are significant buyers of CLO tranches** ([What impact is “higher for longer” having on the CLO market in 2024? – Deutsche Bank](https://flow.db.com/trust-and-agency-services/what-impact-is-higher-for-longer-having-on-the-clo-market-in-2024#:~:text=capital%20markets%20by%20buying%20and,risk%20exposure%20and%20associated%20yields)). Pension funds, seeking higher yields to meet their return targets, have ventured into various parts of the CLO capital stack. Typically, pensions would buy the safer AAA or AA rated CLO notes (which carry credit enhancement and have had a strong track record). However, in recent years some pension plans have even **“reached for yield” by allocating to riskier mezzanine and equity tranches of CLOs** ([Pension funds venture into high-risk CLO equity](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/pension-funds-venture-into-high-risk-clo-equity/#:~:text=Pension%20funds%20venture%20into%20high,CLOs%29%20in%20recent%20months)). For instance, there are reports of pensions investing in specialized funds that focus on the equity (first-loss) piece of CLOs ([Pension funds venture into high-risk CLO equity](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/pension-funds-venture-into-high-risk-clo-equity/#:~:text=Pension%20funds%20venture%20into%20high,CLOs%29%20in%20recent%20months)). U.S. Federal Reserve data from 2018 showed U.S. pension funds held about $22 billion of CLO securities (around 6.6% of total domestic CLO holdings at that time) ([The Fed - Who Owns U.S. CLO Securities? An Update by Tranche](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/who-owns-us-clo-securities-an-update-by-tranche-20200625.html#:~:text=Insurance%20Company%20111%2C610%2032.9,0)). Moreover, nearly **a quarter of the CLO investments held by pension funds were lower-rated (mezzanine or junior) tranches** – exposing them to credit risk if the underlying loans default ([The Fed - Who Owns U.S. CLO Securities? An Update by Tranche](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/who-owns-us-clo-securities-an-update-by-tranche-20200625.html#:~:text=Other%20institutional%20investors%20held%20a,those%20held%20by%20pension%20funds)). This share may have grown as pensions sought to boost returns via alternative credit. In Europe and Asia, pension and sovereign funds have similarly increased allocations to CLO debt. 

**Extent of Exposure and Risks:** In aggregate, pension fund exposure to CLOs is still a small fraction of pension assets (which are in the tens of trillions globally). That said, the exposure is **non-trivial**. The CLO market offers yield premiums over corporate bonds, so it has attracted retirement plan money. A **Deutsche Bank analysis notes that CLOs provide pension funds and insurers “a compelling investment product” with multiple layers of risk/yield to choose from** ([What impact is “higher for longer” having on the CLO market in 2024? – Deutsche Bank](https://flow.db.com/trust-and-agency-services/what-impact-is-higher-for-longer-having-on-the-clo-market-in-2024#:~:text=capital%20markets%20by%20buying%20and,risk%20exposure%20and%20associated%20yields)). The risk, of course, is that if corporate loan defaults rise sharply, the lower tranches of CLOs could take losses. *Senior CLO tranches (AAA/AA) are quite robust* – they typically wouldn’t lose principal unless a large portion of the loan portfolio defaults. But **mezzanine and equity tranches could be hit hard in a severe default cycle**, and investors in those would bear the brunt. If, say, a wave of PE-backed companies default on loans, the CLO equity (often 8–10% of the deal) would likely be wiped out, and mezzanine noteholders could face write-downs. Pension funds holding those positions could see losses. Even holders of AAA tranches might experience mark-to-market volatility (prices dropping) if market liquidity dries up, though actual credit loss to AAA is historically rare. 

**Have CLOs been sold to pension funds?** Yes – **pension funds have been actively buying CLO notes for yield**, often through asset managers or funds. According to a Pensions & Investments report, asset owners have been increasing allocations to CLO debt as part of their fixed-income strategy ([Prime Time for CLOs Strategy Q&A - Pensions & Investments](https://www.pionline.com/CLOs-strategy2024#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWith%20asset%20managers%2C%20pension%20funds,of%20the%20CLO%20market)). Many public pension systems invest in alternative credit funds that include CLO tranches. The **upshot is that pension funds are indirectly exposed to the fortunes of leveraged loans and private equity-backed borrowers via their CLO holdings.** This “iron triangle” of **private equity, CLOs, and pensions has drawn some concern from regulators** who worry about systemic risk ([CLOs, Private Equity, Pensions, and Systemic Risk](https://www.pm-research.com/content/iijstrfin/26/1/8#:~:text=Systemic%20risk%3A%20The%20Iron%20Triangle,GFC)). If a large number of loans default (for example, if interest rates stay high and the economy turns down sharply), the losses could propagate through CLO structures and ultimately ding the portfolios of pensions and insurers. 

**Current Assessment:** As of now, CLO performance remains relatively stable – defaults have ticked up, but **CLO tranches have built-in protection (coverage tests, subordination) and have weathered the stress so far** ([What impact is “higher for longer” having on the CLO market in 2024? – Deutsche Bank](https://flow.db.com/trust-and-agency-services/what-impact-is-higher-for-longer-having-on-the-clo-market-in-2024#:~:text=Signs%20of%20stress%2C%20but%20no,signs%20of%20breaking)). Analysts note “signs of stress, but no signs of breaking” in CLOs under the high-rate environment ([What impact is “higher for longer” having on the CLO market in 2024? – Deutsche Bank](https://flow.db.com/trust-and-agency-services/what-impact-is-higher-for-longer-having-on-the-clo-market-in-2024#:~:text=Signs%20of%20stress%2C%20but%20no,signs%20of%20breaking)). However, the risk is not negligible. Pension funds could face trouble in an extreme scenario (akin to how mortgage CDO exposure hurt some institutions in 2008). The **economic risk is that a feedback loop develops**: widespread defaults → CLO equity wiped out → funding tightens for new loans → more stress on companies. Pensions’ financial health can also be affected if their high-yield investments underperform significantly. In conclusion, it’s accurate that **banks repackaged many PE loans into CLO securities and sold them to investors including pension funds ([What impact is “higher for longer” having on the CLO market in 2024? – Deutsche Bank](https://flow.db.com/trust-and-agency-services/what-impact-is-higher-for-longer-having-on-the-clo-market-in-2024#:~:text=capital%20markets%20by%20buying%20and,risk%20exposure%20and%20associated%20yields)). Pension funds do have meaningful exposure to CLOs – particularly to higher-yield tranches – which could suffer if corporate defaults escalate** ([The Fed - Who Owns U.S. CLO Securities? An Update by Tranche](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/who-owns-us-clo-securities-an-update-by-tranche-20200625.html#:~:text=Other%20institutional%20investors%20held%20a,those%20held%20by%20pension%20funds)). This is an area regulators are watching, though for now CLOs have dispersed the risk broadly, and top-rated tranches (which pensions also hold) still carry a strong safety buffer. The situation bears monitoring, as a serious deterioration in loan performance would test the resilience of pension fund investments in this corner of the market.
