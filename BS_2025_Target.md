# Identifying Distressed PE-Backed Companies  
Private-equity backed firms that relied on heavy leverage are feeling the squeeze from rising rates. Many have **Debt-to-EBITDA ratios well above 6× and interest coverage below 2×**, signaling difficulty covering interest costs from earnings. Notable examples include:  

- **Sabre Corporation (SABR)** – A travel technology company taken private via LBO and later re-listed. Sabre now carries over **11× debt-to-EBITDA**, reflecting its outsized debt load ([Total Debt / EBITDA For Sabre Corpo (SABR) - Finbox](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:SABR/explorer/total_debt_to_ebitda#:~:text=Total%20Debt%20%2F%20EBITDA%20For,3.9x)). With interest coverage <1 (recently ~0.6×) ([Sabre (SABR) Interest Coverage Ratio Chart - SABR Stock Interest Coverage Ratio History](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SABR/value/interest-coverage-ratio#:~:text=Image%3A%20SABR%20LogoSabre%20,59)), Sabre is essentially a “zombie” company unable to fully cover interest from operating profit. Much of its debt is in floating-rate loans, so each Fed rate hike directly increases Sabre’s interest burden.  
- **Community Health Systems (CYH)** – A hospital operator laden with borrowings from acquisitions (while not an LBO, its debt profile resembles one). CYH’s leverage sits around **7–8× EBITDA**, and its interest coverage has slid to roughly **0.9×** ([Interest Coverage Ratio For Community Health Systems Inc (CYH)](https://finbox.com/NYSE:CYH/explorer/interest_coverage#:~:text=Interest%20Coverage%20Ratio%20For%20Community,for%20fiscal%20years%20ending)). Fitch Ratings warns the company’s **EBITDA leverage >8×** in the near term puts it at high risk of a distressed debt exchange or default ([Fitch Affirms IDR for Community Health Systems at 'CCC+'](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-affirms-idr-for-community-health-systems-at-ccc-06-12-2024#:~:text=%27CCC%2B%27%20www,debt%20exchanges%2C%20with%20the)).  
- **Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO)** – This outdoor advertising firm, formerly part of a 2000s LBO, remains highly leveraged at about **10:1 debt-to-cash flow**. Its average debt cost is ~7.5%, and **interest payments consume 78% of cash flow** ([Debt Costs and Leverage Stable at Public OOH Companies | Billboard Insider™](https://billboardinsider.com/debt-costs-and-leverage-stable-for-public-out-of-home-companies/#:~:text=,sharply%20in%202021%20and%202022)), leaving virtually no margin for error. Such thin coverage (≈1.3×) makes Clear Channel extremely vulnerable to any revenue dip or rate uptick.  
- **Joann, Inc. (JOAN)** – The fabric/crafts retailer was taken private by Leonard Green & Partners and re-IPO’d in 2021, still carrying over **$1 billion in debt** ([Joann store closures among many Leonard Green and Partners bankruptcies - Private Equity Stakeholder Project PESP](https://pestakeholder.org/news/joann-store-closures-among-many-leonard-green-and-partners-bankruptcies/#:~:text=deal.,9)). Tariffs on imported goods and falling hobby spending squeezed margins just as interest costs climbed. By early 2024 Joann could no longer service its ~10% floating-rate loans and filed Chapter 11, joining a string of PE-backed retail failures. (Party City is another example – a THL Partners LBO that collapsed under >8× leverage and negative interest coverage ([Five Fast Facts About Party City Holdco Inc. | CreditRiskMonitor](https://www.creditriskmonitor.com/resources/blog-posts/five-fast-facts-about-party-city-holdco-inc#:~:text=This%20was%20not%20a%20new,eventually%20lenders%20must%20be%20paid)).)  

These cases illustrate the pattern: **companies taken private in leveraged buyouts and re-listed often retain high debt loads**. When faced with higher variable interest rates and softening sales, their **debt service becomes untenable**. Many are resorting to cash-conserving tactics (asset sales, cost cuts), but as shown above, interest eats up most of their earnings, putting them at risk of default or bankruptcy.

# ETFs and CLO Exposure  
The distress of these companies extends to **credit markets and funds holding their debt**. High-yield bond and loan ETFs in particular are exposed to struggling LBO-backed issuers: 

- **High-Yield Bond ETFs (HYG, JNK)** – These track junk bonds and inevitably hold the bonds of highly leveraged, PE-sponsored firms. As default risks rise, the value of such bonds falls, dragging down ETF prices. Notably, Moody’s reports the default rate for private-equity backed companies hit **17% (Jan 2022–Aug 2024)** – **twice** that of non-sponsored companies ([Buyout firms’ equity-debt double act is creaking | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/buyout-firms-equity-debt-double-act-is-creaking-2025-02-14/#:~:text=Despite%20these%20advantageous%20loan%20terms%2C,not%20backed%20by%20financial%20sponsors)). This wave of defaults (and distressed exchanges) in PE-heavy issuers could impact broad HY indices and ETFs that hold their bonds.  
- **Floating-Rate Loan ETFs (e.g. Invesco’s BKLN)** – Loan funds invest in leveraged loans (mostly floating-rate) often used in LBO financing. Many at-risk firms like Sabre and Community Health have large Term Loan B tranches that show up in these ETF portfolios. With **leveraged loan default rates jumping to ~4.7% in late 2024 (up from 3.0% a year prior) ([Under pressure: leveraged loan defaults are spiking | DebtDynamics North America - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/under-pressure-leveraged-loan-defaults-are-spiking-debtdynamics-north-america/#:~:text=Annual%20loan%20defaults%20are%20soaring%2C,5))**, loan ETF investors face mounting credit risk. Unlike fixed-rate bonds, these loans don’t lose value from rate moves, but they do suffer if borrowers default.  
- **CLO Tranche Exposure** –  Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) bundle risky loans (often LBO loans) into tranches. The lower-rated **BB and B tranches** of CLOs are most exposed to default upticks, since they absorb losses after equity tranches. If defaults continue rising toward the ~5% level forecasters predict for 2024 ([U.S. Leveraged Loan Default Rate for 2024 Revised Up Amid ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/us-leveraged-loan-default-rate-for-2024-revised-up-amid-deterioration-24-07-2024#:~:text=,4.0)), **mezzanine CLO tranches could face writedowns**. As Fitch notes, recoveries on defaulted buyout loans have been low (~48¢ on the dollar) ([Buyout firms’ equity-debt double act is creaking | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/buyout-firms-equity-debt-double-act-is-creaking-2025-02-14/#:~:text=While%20covenant,creditor%20violence.%E2%80%9D)), so losses will hit the weakest CLO bonds hard. CLO equity holders are already seeing pressure – many borrowers are even paying interest in kind (PIK) to conserve cash. In fact, nearly **10% of net income for U.S. BDC lenders now comes from PIK interest** instead of cash ([Buyout firms’ equity-debt double act is creaking | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/buyout-firms-equity-debt-double-act-is-creaking-2025-02-14/#:~:text=an%20exit%20from%20their%20investments,payments%2C%20according%20to%20S%26P%20Global)), a warning sign that underlying loans (often held in CLOs) are under stress.  

**Which ETFs or vehicles are most at risk?** Broad junk bond ETFs (HYG, JNK) have significant weights in CCC-rated issuers – where most PE-backed distressed names reside. Sector-focused funds can concentrate the risk too (for instance, a retail ETF held Party City and Joann bonds equity before their collapse). On the loan side, CLOs and loan funds spread risk across many issuers, but systemic issues (rate hikes, recession) can hit many at once. **BB-rated CLO tranches** have historically had very low default rates, but that assumes the diversification holds; a wave of LBO loan failures could **breach CLO interest coverage or over-collateralization tests**, diverting cash away from equity and junior noteholders. Investors in vehicles like **CLO funds or high-yield mutual funds** should monitor their portfolios for concentrations in names like those above.

# Shorting Strategies for Leverage Risk  
For investors looking to **bet against or hedge these vulnerable firms and credits**, several strategies exist in the derivatives and credit markets:

- **Credit Default Swaps (CDS) Index Products** – One efficient way to short high-risk corporate credit is via **CDS indices**. The **Markit CDX High Yield index** (North American HY CDS) provides synthetic short exposure to a broad basket of junk bonds. Buying protection on the index profits if spreads widen or defaults increase. These indices inherently overweight highly leveraged issuers (since they have lower ratings), making them a direct play on distress. Similarly, in Europe the **iTraxx Crossover index** focuses on sub-investment-grade credits. By going long CDS protection (essentially “shorting” credit), an investor can target the **rising default risk in low-rated corporate debt**.  
- **Put Options and Inverse ETFs** – Equity or ETF options allow a directional short bet against these firms or their debt. For instance, one could buy **put options on ETFs like HYG** (high-yield bond ETF) or **BKLN** (leveraged loan ETF) to profit from a credit selloff. There is even an inverse high-yield ETF (ticker SJB) that shorts junk bonds. These instruments would gain if **bond prices fall or loan NAVs drop due to defaults**. Investors expecting trouble in a specific sector can also target ETFs – e.g. buying puts on a retail or consumer discretionary ETF that holds many leveraged retailers. On the equity side, buying puts on the stock of a highly levered company (or shorting the stock outright) is another strategy – though equity often finds some support if creditors extend lifelines.  
- **Shorting CLO Mezzanine Tranches** – While not readily accessible to most retail investors, sophisticated traders can short **CLO tranches** or related instruments. This might involve buying CDS on a bundle of BB-rated tranches or via total return swaps with banks. The idea is to position for **losses in the lower CLO tranches** if defaults spike. (No broad ETF tracks CLO mezzanine, so this usually requires bespoke trades.) As a proxy, one could short funds exposed to these tranches or go long volatility on leveraged loan indexes.  
- **Macro Hedging** – Since a wave of PE-driven failures could have systemic effects, one can hedge macro-wide. **Shorting small-cap indices** (Russell 2000, for example) can indirectly short “zombie” firms, as many highly levered companies are smaller caps. Similarly, **long volatility positions** or **steepener trades** (expecting credit spreads to jump relative to risk-free rates) could pay off in a credit downturn. Another angle is shorting the debt of financially weak companies via bond or loan CDS, if single-name CDS are available (e.g. buying CDS on a troubled issuer like Community Health or Altice USA).  

In employing these strategies, investors should note timing is critical. Distressed credits can trade at deep discounts for months before defaulting, and carry costs (e.g. CDS premiums or option decay) can eat into profits. Nonetheless, hedging through the above instruments can protect a portfolio from a **wider contagion in the leveraged loan and private credit market**, which many see as a growing possibility.

# Systemic Risk & The First Dominoes to Fall  
There are growing signs that **excess leverage in PE-backed firms is translating into broader financial stress**. Rising interest rates, lingering tariffs, and shaky consumer confidence are combining to push the weakest companies over the edge. Early dominoes have already fallen in several sectors:

- **Retail/Consumer Discretionary:** This sector has seen multiple LBO-backed casualties as consumer sentiment soured. **Party City** (party supplies), **Bed Bath & Beyond** (home goods, not PE-owned but highly leveraged), **Joann Stores**, and others all filed bankruptcy as sales declined and debt service became impossible. Tariffs on imported inventory and higher supply chain costs also squeezed margins ([Private credit market, high on M&A hopes, deregulation, recoils at ...](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/private-credit-market-high-on-m-a-hope-deregulation-recoils-at-tariffs#:~:text=,challenges%20as%20labor%20costs%20increase)). Fitch noted the consumer sector contributed **3 of the 14 largest corporate defaults** in a recent 12-month period ([Default Rate Rises in Fitch's U.S. Privately Monitored Corporate ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/default-rate-rises-in-fitchs-us-privately-monitored-corporate-ratings-portfolio-11-06-2024#:~:text=Default%20Rate%20Rises%20in%20Fitch%27s,no%20common%20theme%20causing)). These were largely chain retailers that had been debt-laden by private equity owners. The retail **default rate hit ~7% in 2020** and was projected to reach into the teens ([Fitch Ratings Anticipating Historic Loan Defaults for April | the deep dive](https://thedeepdive.ca/fitch-ratings-anticipating-historic-loan-defaults-for-april/#:~:text=pharmaceutical%2Fhealthcare%20sector)), and while not that high now, it’s again ticking up with names like **Instant Brands** (maker of Pyrex and Instant Pot) and **Christmas Tree Shops** defaulting. Retailers are often the first dominoes because of cyclical sales and thin margins that can’t support heavy interest in a downturn.  
- **Healthcare Services:** Healthcare companies that were roll-ups by PE (especially those relying on reimbursement) are under acute strain. Fitch reported **4 of 14 recent large defaults were in healthcare** ([Default Rate Rises in Fitch's U.S. Privately Monitored Corporate ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/default-rate-rises-in-fitchs-us-privately-monitored-corporate-ratings-portfolio-11-06-2024#:~:text=Default%20Rate%20Rises%20in%20Fitch%27s,no%20common%20theme%20causing)). Notable failures include **Envision Healthcare** (ER staffing firm owned by KKR) and **Prospect Medical Holdings** (Leonard Green & Partners) – both buckled under unsustainable debt. **Labor cost inflation and regulatory changes** have hurt these firms’ cash flows. Fitch notes that the typical PE-driven healthcare roll-up has faced **surging wages and Medicare reimbursement cuts**, undermining their business model ([Under pressure: leveraged loan defaults are spiking | DebtDynamics North America - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/under-pressure-leveraged-loan-defaults-are-spiking-debtdynamics-north-america/#:~:text=The%20healthcare%20sector%20recently%20has,coverage%20for%20certain%20emergency%20services)). The sector’s woes are widespread: the No Surprises Act and reduced COVID aid have further crimped revenues ([Under pressure: leveraged loan defaults are spiking | DebtDynamics North America - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/under-pressure-leveraged-loan-defaults-are-spiking-debtdynamics-north-america/#:~:text=The%20healthcare%20sector%20recently%20has,coverage%20for%20certain%20emergency%20services)). Highly leveraged hospital operators and physician groups are thus prime candidates for the next defaults as they struggle to meet interest payments.  
- **Technology/Media/Telecom:**  Tech and telecom saw many leveraged buyouts in the 2010s (for instance, **Avaya**, **Intelsat**, **Cineworld/Regal**). As of late 2024, **technology and healthcare together made up ~45% of loan default volume** by sector ([Under pressure: leveraged loan defaults are spiking | DebtDynamics North America - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/under-pressure-leveraged-loan-defaults-are-spiking-debtdynamics-north-america/#:~:text=Technology%20and%20healthcare%20have%20been,volume%20since%20October%20last%20year)). In telecom/media, we’ve witnessed defaults of **Diamond Sports/Bally Sports** (Sinclair’s debt-heavy sports network unit) and restructurings at others like Frontier Communications. These companies were highly leveraged and then hit by either secular decline or revenue shocks (e.g. cord-cutting in media). Rising interest costs force them to restructure even if their core business is stable because debt service becomes untenable.  
- **Industrials/Energy:** Thus far, industrial companies with PE ownership have seen fewer early defaults, but stress is evident in certain cases. For example, **American Tire Distributors** (an LBO’d firm) went bankrupt in 2023 due to inflation and falling demand ([Under pressure: leveraged loan defaults are spiking | DebtDynamics North America - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/under-pressure-leveraged-loan-defaults-are-spiking-debtdynamics-north-america/#:~:text=October%2C%20with%20the%20total%20default,petition%20funded%20debt)). In energy, PE-backed explorers suffered during previous oil price crashes; with higher rates now, even midstream or service companies carrying LBO debt could struggle if commodity prices dip. The **energy sector’s default rate spiked to 5.5%** in 2020’s downturn and was forecast to hit 18% that year with multiple bankruptcies ([Fitch Ratings Anticipating Historic Loan Defaults for April | the deep dive](https://thedeepdive.ca/fitch-ratings-anticipating-historic-loan-defaults-for-april/#:~:text=For%20the%20energy%20sector%2C%20the,Seadrill%20Partners%2C%20and%20Chesapeake%20Energy)) – illustrating how quickly conditions can deteriorate for over-levered companies when market winds shift.

**Key systemic signals to watch:** One is the overall **leveraged loan default rate**, which has climbed to multi-year highs. In the U.S. it’s around **4–5% and rising** ([Under pressure: leveraged loan defaults are spiking | DebtDynamics North America - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/under-pressure-leveraged-loan-defaults-are-spiking-debtdynamics-north-america/#:~:text=Annual%20loan%20defaults%20are%20soaring%2C,5)), the highest since the Great Financial Crisis aside from the 2020 spike. Rating agencies expect defaults to continue increasing into 2024 as more debt comes due ([U.S. Leveraged Loan Default Rate for 2024 Revised Up Amid ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/us-leveraged-loan-default-rate-for-2024-revised-up-amid-deterioration-24-07-2024#:~:text=,4.0)). Another warning sign is **credit downgrades and covenant breaches** – many highly levered firms have covenant-lite loans, but those with maintenance covenants are starting to trip them. For instance, some are breaching interest coverage ratios, which forces renegotiations with lenders. We’re also seeing more **distressed exchanges** (where a company asks lenders to take a haircut or extend maturities); Fitch finds a majority of recent loan defaults have been via these exchanges rather than outright Chapter 11 ([Under pressure: leveraged loan defaults are spiking | DebtDynamics North America - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/under-pressure-leveraged-loan-defaults-are-spiking-debtdynamics-north-america/#:~:text=Distressing%20situations)), indicating companies are scrambling to buy time. 

Ultimately, the **“first dominoes” tend to fall in sectors with a combination of cyclical weakness and high leverage** – exactly where private equity activity has been intense. The recent record pace of PE-backed bankruptcies (110 PE/VC-owned firms filed in 2024, a record high ([‘Leveraged to the hilt’: PE-backed firms hit by wave of bankruptcies : r/Economics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1i9nj3p/leveraged_to_the_hilt_pebacked_firms_hit_by_wave/#:~:text=Summary%20of%20article%3A))) underscores that the **PE business model of maximal leverage is cracking under today’s high-rate environment**. Investors should be prepared for continued fallout. Defaults that start in highly leveraged niche corners (retail, small-cap health care, etc.) can spread via contagion – hitting CLOs, then bank balance sheets and credit markets at large. By identifying which companies are most vulnerable now (high debt, low coverage, floating-rate exposure) and hedging or avoiding those risks, one can hopefully stay ahead of the cascading distress in the leveraged loan and private credit arenas.
