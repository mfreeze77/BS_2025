# Distressed Company Financial Analysis: Sabre, Community Health Systems, Clear Channel Outdoor, and Joann

## Introduction  
This report examines four highly leveraged, private-equity-backed companies – **Sabre Corporation (SABR)**, **Community Health Systems (CYH)**, **Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO)**, and **Joann, Inc. (JOAN)** – using a standardized framework. All four have struggled under heavy debt loads and rising interest rates. We analyze their debt structures, interest coverage trends, refinancing risks, cash flow sustainability, and potential recovery values in distress. Tables and charts are included to facilitate comparisons across these companies and sectors.

## Debt Structure Breakdown  
Each company’s capital structure is dominated by substantial debt, but the **composition of that debt and exposure to interest rate changes** vary:

- **Sabre (SABR)** – *Total Debt:* ~$5.0 billion. Sabre’s debt consists of multiple secured term loans and notes, both fixed and floating. **About 28% of Sabre’s debt is floating-rate** (after considering interest rate swaps) ([Source.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=Loan%20due%20in%202028%2C%20approximately,large%20portion%20of%20Travel%20Solutions)), exposing it to rate hikes. The remainder is fixed-rate, including senior secured notes (8.625% and 11.25% coupons due 2027) and a convertible note (4.0% due 2025). Sabre recently refinanced most of its 2025 maturities by issuing new 2027/2028 notes, significantly reducing near-term pressures ([Sabre expands its accounts receivable securitization facility to $235 ...](https://investors.sabre.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sabre-expands-its-accounts-receivable-securitization-facility#:~:text=,was%20previously%20maturing%20in%202025)). **Maturity profile:** only $0.55B comes due in 2025; the bulk ($2.4B) matures in 2027 and another ~$2.0B in 2028 ([Source.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=Years%20Ending%20December%2031%2C%202024,risks%20relating%20to%20ongoing%20business)). Sabre’s credit agreements are *covenant-lite* (no ongoing financial maintenance covenants on term loans or bonds). There is a springing maturity on its $110M accounts-receivable (AR) securitization facility if not extended past Jan 2025 ([Source.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=Senior%20Secured%20Term%20Loan%20Due,outstanding%20%24%204%2C957%2C863%20%24%204%2C815%2C646)) ([Source.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=,which%20were%20secured%20by%20a)), but otherwise Sabre faces no covenant hurdles as long as it refinances before 2027.

- **Community Health Systems (CYH)** – *Total Debt:* ~$11.5 billion ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=Less%3A%20Unamortized%20deferred%20debt%20issuance,costs)). CHS’s capital structure is complex, with **over 10 tranches of debt**, nearly all at fixed interest rates (secured and unsecured notes). The only floating-rate exposure is its asset-based loan (**ABL**) revolver (drawn ~$372M as of Q3 2024) ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=ABL%20Facility)), which is ~3% of total debt. In 2023–2024 CHS undertook major refinancings: it issued **$1.225B of new 10.875% first-lien notes due 2032** ([Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=Quarterly%20Report%20for%20Quarter%20Ending,aggregate%20principal%20amount%20of)) to retire an $1.1B note due 2026, pushing out maturities at the cost of a higher rate. Now **no significant maturities occur until 2027**, when ~$2.46B of first-lien notes (8.00% and 5.625% coupons) come due ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=8,2027)) ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=5%20%E2%85%9D,due%202027)). Further maturities follow in 2028 ($626M unsecured), 2029 (~$1.89B across secured and “junior priority” second-lien notes), 2030 (~$2.76B), 2031 ($1.06B), and 2032 ($2.23B) ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=6%20%E2%85%9E,2028)) ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=1%2C058)). **Covenants:** CHS’s debt is under a classic first-lien/second-lien structure with incurrence covenants. The ABL revolver has a *springing fixed-charge coverage ratio* test of 1.0× if availability falls below a threshold (about $12M, ~10% of capacity) ([](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000086682924000028/R48.htm#:~:text=Debt%20Instrument%20,0)) ([](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000086682924000028/R48.htm#:~:text=Permitted%20debt%20for%20the%20deferred,0%20Maximum)) – effectively forcing CHS to maintain a liquidity cushion or positive EBITDA after rent/interest. This covenant did not trigger at YE 2024 due to adequate borrowing base headroom, but it remains a key constraint if operations or cash reserves deteriorate.

- **Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO)** – *Total Debt:* ~$5.66 billion ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024 :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.

CCO’s debt is **100% fixed-rate senior notes**; it has **no meaningful floating-rate debt** or traditional bank term loans. Major instruments include $1.25B of 5.125% senior secured notes due 2027, $1.00B of 7.75% unsecured notes due 2028, $1.05B of 7.5% unsecured notes due 2029, and $750M of 9.0% secured notes due 2029 ([Debt Info :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.

After those sales, **CCO’s next scheduled maturity is April 2027, when a $375M term loan comes due, followed by August 2027 when $1.25B of 5.125% notes mature ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.

There are no maintenance covenants on CCO’s bonds; any revolver or term facility covenants were rendered moot as the company has been selling non-U.S. divisions and using proceeds to deleverage. Overall, CCO’s debt is long-dated but high-cost, and its **negative shareholder equity** reflects the heavy debt burden ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Balance Sheet Health](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-cco/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings/health#:~:text=Clear%20Channel%20Outdoor%20Holdings%20Balance,Financial%20Health)).

- **Joann, Inc. (JOAN)** – *Total Debt (pre-bankruptcy):* ~$1.06 billion ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=The%20debt)) ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=JOANN%20enters%20Chapter%2011%20with,outstanding%2C%20respectively%2C%20on%20that%20facility)). Joann’s debt was composed of a senior secured term loan (outstanding $658.1M) and an asset-based credit facility ($286.4M ABL plus a $115.7M “first-in, last-out” FILO term loan) ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=JOANN%20enters%20Chapter%2011%20with,outstanding%2C%20respectively%2C%20on%20that%20facility)). **All of JOAN’s debt carried floating interest rates**, tied to LIBOR/SOFR plus a spread (the term loan was under a 2016 credit agreement, and the ABL/FILO had typical variable rates) ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=JOANN%20enters%20Chapter%2011%20with,outstanding%2C%20respectively%2C%20on%20that%20facility)). This 100% floating-rate exposure meant Joann’s interest expense rose sharply with Fed rate hikes. **Maturities:** the ABL was scheduled to mature in 2026 and the term loan in 2028, but Joann never made it that far. **Covenants:** The ABL/FILO facility had a springing fixed-charge coverage covenant (1.0× test) when availability dropped below a threshold. By late 2023, Joann was in a liquidity crisis – the revolver was nearly fully drawn and availability low – effectively triggering covenant default. Without a waiver or restructuring, the company **could not meet the covenant or refinance**, precipitating a Chapter 11 filing in March 2024 ([

In bankruptcy, Joann’s debt structure has been reworked (half the term loan converted to equity and new financing obtained), but the pre-petition debt metrics highlight how vulnerable the structure was to cash flow shortfalls.

 ([image]()) *Floating-rate debt as a percentage of total debt for each company (as of late 2024). Sabre has ~28% of its debt at variable rates ([Source.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=Loan%20due%20in%202028%2C%20approximately,large%20portion%20of%20Travel%20Solutions)), partly hedged via swaps, whereas CHS and CCO have minimal floating exposure (their debt is predominantly fixed-rate). Joann’s debt was effectively all floating-rate ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=JOANN%20enters%20Chapter%2011%20with,outstanding%2C%20respectively%2C%20on%20that%20facility)), leaving it highly vulnerable to rising interest rates.*  

**Key Takeaways:** Sabre and Joann had the highest exposure to interest rate increases due to floating-rate debt (Sabre 28%, Joann 100%). CHS and CCO locked in most debt at fixed rates, shielding them from immediate rate spikes. However, CHS’s and CCO’s fixed coupons are relatively high, reflecting past distress and refinancing terms. All four companies face **concentrated maturity “walls”** in the coming years – Sabre in 2027–28, CHS in 2027–2030, CCO in 2027–2029, and Joann (pre-filing) in 2026–2028 – making proactive refinancing or restructuring essential.

## Interest Coverage Ratio Trends  
Interest coverage – the ability to pay interest from earnings – has been **weakening for all four companies**, with most now unable to cover interest costs from operating profit. The chart below shows EBIT/Interest Expense ratios from 2019 through 2024 for Sabre, CHS, and CCO (Joann’s pattern is discussed separately). A ratio below 1× means interest expense exceeds EBIT, signaling unsustainable debt service without additional cash sources.

 ([image]()) *Interest coverage ratios (EBIT ÷ interest expense) from 2019–2024. Sabre (SABR) is shown in gold, Community Health (CYH) in orange, and Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO) in pink. A ratio below the gray 1.0× line indicates EBIT is insufficient to cover interest. Sabre’s coverage plunged from ~3.3× in 2019 to negative in 2020–2022 (plotted as 0) ([Sabre (SABR) Interest Coverage Ratio Chart - SABR Stock Interest Coverage Ratio History](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SABR/value/interest-coverage-ratio#:~:text=12%2F31%2F2022%20,498.33)) due to pandemic losses, then partially rebounded to 0.59× by 2024 ([Sabre (SABR) Interest Coverage Ratio Chart - SABR Stock Interest Coverage Ratio History](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SABR/value/interest-coverage-ratio#:~:text=Date%20TTM%20EBIT%20TTM%20Net,0.34%2077.90)). CYH’s coverage peaked near 1.4× in 2021 amid one-time gains (asset sales, CARES Act aid) but fell below 1× again by 2022–2024 ([Interest Coverage Ratio For Community Health Systems Inc (CYH)](https://finbox.com/NYSE:CYH/explorer/interest_coverage#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%27s%20interest%20coverage,4x%2C%20%2B)). CCO’s coverage dropped during 2020’s advertising slump and has slowly improved to ~0.8× by 2024 ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Balance Sheet Health](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-cco/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings/health#:~:text=Clear%20Channel%20Outdoor%20Holdings%20Balance,Financial%20Health)) – still well below safe levels.* 

- **Sabre:** Prior to COVID-19, Sabre had solid interest coverage (≈3.3× EBIT/Interest in 2019) ([Sabre (SABR) Interest Coverage Ratio Chart - SABR Stock Interest Coverage Ratio History](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SABR/value/interest-coverage-ratio#:~:text=6%2F30%2F2022%20,153.27)). The pandemic devastated Sabre’s revenue (travel IT services), causing deep EBIT losses and **negative** coverage in 2020–2021 (EBIT was –$637M in 2021, so interest coverage was –2.47×) ([Sabre (SABR) Interest Coverage Ratio Chart - SABR Stock Interest Coverage Ratio History](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SABR/value/interest-coverage-ratio#:~:text=6%2F30%2F2022%20,498.33)). Even in 2022, as travel demand began recovering, Sabre’s EBIT was still negative (coverage –0.76×) ([Sabre (SABR) Interest Coverage Ratio Chart - SABR Stock Interest Coverage Ratio History](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SABR/value/interest-coverage-ratio#:~:text=6%2F30%2F2023%20,2%2048.09)). In 2023, Sabre finally returned to positive EBIT, but only enough for 0.14× coverage ([Sabre (SABR) Interest Coverage Ratio Chart - SABR Stock Interest Coverage Ratio History](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SABR/value/interest-coverage-ratio#:~:text=3%2F31%2F2024%20%24160,1.06%2062.02)). For full-year 2024, coverage improved to ~0.6× as travel volumes grew and costs were cut ([Sabre (SABR) Interest Coverage Ratio Chart - SABR Stock Interest Coverage Ratio History](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SABR/value/interest-coverage-ratio#:~:text=Date%20TTM%20EBIT%20TTM%20Net,0.34%2077.90)). **Bottom line:** Sabre’s operating earnings are still nowhere near covering its interest obligations. In dollars, 2024 EBIT was ~$300M versus ~$507M interest expense – interest consumed all earnings and more ([Sabre (SABR) Interest Coverage Ratio Chart - SABR Stock Interest Coverage Ratio History](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SABR/value/interest-coverage-ratio#:~:text=Date%20TTM%20EBIT%20TTM%20Net,0.34%2077.90)). Rising interest rates have exacerbated this: Sabre’s interest expense jumped $62M in 2024 vs 2023 due to higher borrowing costs ([[PDF] Sabre reports significant financial improvement in 2024 results](https://investors.sabre.com/static-files/57182a46-0283-43f2-aa60-1ee4f094bce0#:~:text=,modification%20costs%20associated%20with%20the)), offsetting improvements in EBITDA. Until Sabre’s EBITDA grows substantially (or debt is reduced), interest coverage will remain below 1×, indicating continued strain.

- **Community Health Systems:** CHS has struggled with chronically low coverage for years. In 2019, interest coverage was only ~0.9× ([Interest Coverage Ratio For Community Health Systems Inc (CYH)](https://finbox.com/NYSE:CYH/explorer/interest_coverage#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%27s%20interest%20coverage,4x%2C%20%2B)) – even before COVID, CHS’s ~$800M interest expense nearly matched its EBIT. The pandemic initially worsened coverage to ~0.6× in 2020 ([Interest Coverage Ratio For Community Health Systems Inc (CYH)](https://finbox.com/NYSE:CYH/explorer/interest_coverage#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%27s%20interest%20coverage,4x%2C%20%2B)) as elective procedures fell. In 2021, CHS benefited from one-time federal relief and aggressive cost cuts, temporarily boosting coverage to ~1.4× ([Interest Coverage Ratio For Community Health Systems Inc (CYH)](https://finbox.com/NYSE:CYH/explorer/interest_coverage#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%27s%20interest%20coverage,4x%2C%20%2B)). However, this rebound was short-lived. By 2022, **labor cost inflation and shrinking revenues** drove coverage back down to ~0.8× ([Interest Coverage Ratio For Community Health Systems Inc (CYH)](https://finbox.com/NYSE:CYH/explorer/interest_coverage#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%27s%20interest%20coverage,4x%2C%20%2B)). CHS’s trailing coverage in 2023 was around 1.0× (EBIT ~$843M vs interest ~$850M) ([Community Health Systems Inc. Financial Statements - CYH - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CYH/financials#:~:text=Total%20Debt%20to%20Total%20Equity,)) ([Community Health Systems, Inc. Announces Third Quarter Ended ...](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241023073443/en/Community-Health-Systems-Inc.-Announces-Third-Quarter-Ended-September-30-2024-Results#:~:text=,excludes%20the%20amortization%20of)) – essentially break-even before interest. In 2024, conditions deteriorated: CHS projected $840–860M in interest expense ([Community Health Systems, Inc. Announces Third Quarter Ended ...](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241023073443/en/Community-Health-Systems-Inc.-Announces-Third-Quarter-Ended-September-30-2024-Results#:~:text=,excludes%20the%20amortization%20of)), while EBITDA declined with patient volumes and higher wages, implying EBIT well below interest. One estimate put CHS’s 2024 interest coverage at only ~0.3× (i.e. EBIT only ~30% of interest) as results weakened in the second half of the year. Indeed, by November 2024 CHS’s interest coverage was reported at 0.29× ([CYH (Community Health Systems) Interest Coverage - GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/interest_coverage/NYSE:CYH#:~:text=CYH%20,calculation%2C%20historical%20data%20and)). This indicates CHS is back to **operating at a loss after interest**. The company has been selling hospitals to manage debt, but those asset sales also reduce EBITDA, keeping coverage extremely tight ([Community Health Systems ($CYH): Identifying Value Across $12 Billion of Debt](https://www.junkbondinvestor.com/p/community-health-systems-cyh-identifying#:~:text=Today%2C%20leverage%20%28%2411,outline%20key%20covenant%2Fmarket%20participant%20considerations)). In summary, CHS can barely cover (or is failing to cover) its cash interest costs from operations – a precarious situation for a company with $12B debt. Any uptick in interest rates or downturn in earnings could push coverage deep into negative territory.

- **Clear Channel Outdoor:** CCO’s interest coverage has been persistently weak, reflecting its high debt and limited profitability. In 2019, CCO’s EBIT was so low relative to interest that coverage was roughly 0.5× (after adjusting for certain charges) – essentially half the interest was not covered by earnings. The 2020 pandemic caused advertising revenues to plummet, resulting in negative EBIT and **no coverage** (CCO’s net loss in 2020 meant EBIT/Interest < 0). As ad spending recovered, CCO’s coverage improved: ~0.5× in 2021 and ~0.6× in 2022. By 2023, cost-cutting and a rebound in U.S. billboard demand lifted interest coverage to ~0.7×. For 2024, with the sale of its European segment, CCO’s EBITDA from continuing operations was ~$490M while interest was about $394M, yielding coverage near **0.8×** ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Balance Sheet Health](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-cco/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings/health#:~:text=Clear%20Channel%20Outdoor%20Holdings%20Balance,Financial%20Health)). This is the highest coverage CCO has achieved in years – yet still below 1.0×. In effect, CCO continues to run at an operating deficit after paying interest. The company’s interest burden (>$400M/year) remains extremely high relative to its earnings. Unless CCO can significantly grow EBITDA or reduce debt, interest will keep consuming nearly all cash flow. It’s worth noting that CCO’s coverage metrics use EBIT; on a cash flow basis (EBITDA to interest), coverage is slightly better (~1.2× in 2024 since depreciation is a large non-cash expense in this asset-heavy business). However, even by that measure, CCO has little headroom. The gradual improvement from 0.5× to 0.8× over 2021–2024 is positive, but with coverage <1, CCO is still **dependent on external sources (asset sales, cash reserves) to meet interest costs** in full.

- **Joann:** Joann’s interest coverage history illustrates a dramatic boom-bust cycle. The company went from *deep losses* pre-pandemic to a temporary profit spike, and back to losses, ultimately failing to cover interest by a wide margin. In FY2019, Joann lost over $546M ([

The COVID pandemic oddly gave Joann a boost – demand for fabric and crafts (for DIY masks and stay-at-home projects) surged, leading to FY2020 profits of ~$211M ([

Interest coverage briefly turned positive during that period. However, as stimulus and pandemic effects faded, Joann’s sales and margins eroded. By FY2022 (year ended Jan 2023), Joann was back to losses – the company’s EBIT was negative again due to falling revenue and high costs, while annual interest expense was roughly $50–60M. Thus, coverage in 2022–2023 fell below 0× (no EBIT to pay interest). This trend continued to worsen into 2023: Joann’s trailing 12-month EBITDA turned negative, and the company started missing interest payments without drawing on its revolver. By early 2024, **Joann had effectively zero interest coverage – it was relying on credit line borrowings to pay interest**, a clearly unsustainable situation. The company’s own disclosures signaled distress: Joann’s stock was delisted for trading under $1 ([

Indeed, Joann **filed for bankruptcy in March 2024** to restructure its debt ([

In summary, Joann could not generate enough operating earnings to service its debt after 2021. The brief pandemic-driven improvement was followed by a sharp decline, leaving Joann with persistent negative coverage and necessitating court-supervised restructuring.

**Comparison:** All four companies now exhibit **sub-1× interest coverage** (or did so prior to Joann’s bankruptcy). Sabre and CCO have shown some improvement from pandemic lows but still only cover ~60–80% of interest from EBIT. CHS briefly reached coverage >1× in 2021 but has since fallen back and is deteriorating. Joann’s coverage turned negative and led to default. This reflects both weak earnings and, in some cases, **rising interest costs**: e.g. CHS’s interest expense actually increased in 2023–2024 as it refinanced at higher rates, and Sabre’s interest expense rose with floating rates ([[PDF] Sabre reports significant financial improvement in 2024 results](https://investors.sabre.com/static-files/57182a46-0283-43f2-aa60-1ee4f094bce0#:~:text=,modification%20costs%20associated%20with%20the)). The high-rate environment has squeezed these distressed borrowers, eliminating any margin of safety. Notably, **interest coverage below 1× means these firms must use cash reserves, asset sales, or new borrowings to pay interest** – a situation that cannot persist indefinitely. It’s a red flag for potential restructuring if not corrected by earnings growth or debt reduction.

## Refinancing Risk Assessment  
Refinancing risk is a critical issue for these companies given looming maturities and the current high-interest-rate market. We assess the impact of refinancing their debts at today’s market rates:

- **Sabre:** Sabre moved proactively to address its 2025 refinancing cliff. In late 2023, it executed exchange offers that **refinanced ~89% of its 2025 maturities** into new secured notes due 2027 ([Sabre Corporation Announces Settlement of the Exchange Offers for ...](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sabre-corporation-announces-settlement-of-the-exchange-offers-for-certain-senior-secured-debt-securities-due-2025-and-issuance-of-new-notes-due-2027-301921289.html#:~:text=The%20transaction%20strengthens%20Sabre%27s%20balance,excluding%20its%20account)). This significantly pushed out Sabre’s nearest large maturity (only ~$102M of the original ~$930M 2025 notes remain). As a result, Sabre’s next major refinancing need isn’t until **late 2027** (when $2.96B of various term loans and notes come due) ([Source.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=2024%20%24%204%2C040%202025%20553%2C120,The%20primary%20risk%20managed)). However, the *refinancing risk is not eliminated – only deferred*. Sabre’s ability to handle the 2027–2028 wall will depend on credit market conditions and its performance by then. If Sabre had to refinance all ~$4.4B coming due in 2027–28 at today’s rates, interest costs would soar. For example, many of Sabre’s existing notes carry coupons in the 7.5–9.25% range ([Source.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=Senior%20Secured%20Term%20Loan%20Due,23%2C480)); new debt of comparable seniority in today’s climate might demand double-digit yields (given Sabre’s single-**B-** credit rating). Refinancing $4.4B at, say, 10% instead of 7% would increase annual interest expense by roughly $130 million – a sizeable hit for a company with under $500M EBITDA. Sabre has tried to mitigate this with interest rate swaps and by even issuing some **PIK-toggle debt** (a $754M term loan due 2028 that can pay in kind) ([Source.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=2022%20Term%20Loan%20B,December%202027%20555%2C000%20555%2C000)) ([Source.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=maturity%20conditions%3B%20the%20maturity%20may,million%20as%20of%20December%2031)). Those steps buy time and flexibility. Still, Sabre’s **refinancing risk remains high**: it effectively exchanged near-term default risk for medium-term risk. The company is banking on improved cash flow or a lower-rate environment by 2027. If credit markets remain tight and Sabre’s leverage is still high, refinancing its 2027 notes and loans could be challenging and costly (potentially requiring further exchanges or additional collateral to entice lenders). In summary, Sabre averted a 2025 crunch, but faces a formidable refinancing in 2–3 years. Successful refinancing at reasonable rates will likely require continued recovery in travel bookings (to boost EBITDA) and perhaps asset-backed lending (Sabre could expand its AR facility or other secured financing to reduce reliance on public debt markets).

- **Community Health Systems:** CHS has a **significant refinancing challenge** in the second half of this decade. The company took a major step in 2024 by dealing with its nearest maturity: it **refinanced $1.1B of 8.0% notes due 2026 with new 10.875% notes due 2032** ([Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=Quarterly%20Report%20for%20Quarter%20Ending,aggregate%20principal%20amount%20of)). This transaction eliminated the 2026 maturity overhang, but at a price – the interest rate on that debt jumped nearly 3 percentage points. Refinancing at today’s high yields will materially increase CHS’s interest burden, as illustrated by that deal (adding ~$30M of annual interest). CHS still has **large maturities in 2027 and 2028** to handle. In 2027, ~$2.46B of senior secured notes mature ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=8,2027)) (coupons 5.625% and 8.00%). By current market conditions, refinancing those could cost on the order of 10–12% interest, given CHS’s **CCC+** credit rating ([Community Health Systems ($CYH): Identifying Value Across $12 Billion of Debt](https://www.junkbondinvestor.com/p/community-health-systems-cyh-identifying#:~:text=Today%2C%20leverage%20%28%2411,outline%20key%20covenant%2Fmarket%20participant%20considerations)). Similarly, the $626M of unsecured 6.875% notes due 2028 would likely need refinancing at a very high yield or restructuring – these bonds have been trading around 60¢ on the dollar (approx. 18% yield-to-maturity) amid investor skepticism about repayment ([Community Health Systems ($CYH): Identifying Value Across $12 Billion of Debt](https://www.junkbondinvestor.com/p/community-health-systems-cyh-identifying#:~:text=Today%2C%20leverage%20%28%2411,outline%20key%20covenant%2Fmarket%20participant%20considerations)). CHS has acknowledged this risk and has employed strategies like debt tenders and open-market repurchases at discounts ([Community Health Systems Inc. Downgraded To 'SD'](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3226344#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%20Inc,notes%20due%202028%20for)) to reduce some unsecured debt. In fact, S&P downgraded CHS to *Selective Default (SD)* in late 2023 when CHS repurchased ~$130M of its 2028 notes at a steep discount ([Community Health Systems Inc. Downgraded To 'SD'](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3226344#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%20Inc,notes%20due%202028%20for)), effectively a distressed exchange. **Refinancing at current market rates would be punitive for CHS**: for instance, rolling over a $1.75B note from ~5.625% to ~12% would add ~$110M in yearly interest. With CHS’s EBIT barely covering $850M of interest now, such increases would almost certainly push the company into negative cash flow. The company’s strategy to mitigate refinancing risk has been to **sell assets (hospitals)** and use proceeds to pay down debt. This reduces the amount needing refinancing, but has limits – CHS has already sold 80+ hospitals since 2017 ([Community Health Systems ($CYH): Identifying Value Across $12 Billion of Debt](https://www.junkbondinvestor.com/p/community-health-systems-cyh-identifying#:~:text=through,labor%20costs%2C%20eroding%20CYH%E2%80%99s%20profitability)). As it sells more, its earnings base shrinks. There is also operational risk: CHS must retain enough profitable hospitals to support any new debt. In summary, CHS’s refinancing risk is **acute**. The successful tack-on offering in 2024 (albeit at 10.875%) shows the company can still tap capital markets, but further refinancing likely hinges on asset sales and perhaps creditor concessions. If credit conditions don’t improve, CHS may eventually face restructuring to address the chunk of junior debt that can’t be refinanced or repaid through asset divestitures.

- **Clear Channel Outdoor:** CCO has managed near-term refinancing risk by pursuing strategic asset sales. It sold its Europe-South division in 2023 and completed the sale of its Europe-North division in early 2024 for ~$615M ([Document - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334978/000133497822000006/exhibit991-ccohearningsrel.htm#:~:text=We%20anticipate%20having%20approximately%20%24323,assuming%20we%20do%20not)) ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.

Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024 :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCO)](https://investor.clearchannel.com/news/detail/522/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings-inc-reports-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-of-2024#:~:text=Our%20next%20scheduled%20debt%20maturity,businesses%2C%20which%20we%20expect%20to)). Those notes carry a 5.125% coupon – relatively low cost debt which was issued when rates were lower. The risk is that **if CCO cannot repay or extend those notes by 2027, any refinancing would likely price at a much higher rate**. CCO’s unsecured bonds already have coupons of 7.5%–7.75%, and its more recent secured debt came at 9% ([Debt Info :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCO)](https://investor.clearchannel.com/stock-and-debt-info/debt-info#:~:text=CCOH%20Senior%20Notes%2004%2F15%2F2028%207.750,annually%20in%20arrears)) ([Debt Info :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.

Given CCO’s leverage and B/B- credit profile, new debt in 2025–2027 could easily demand high-single-digit to low-double-digit yields. For example, refinancing the $1.25B at ~9% instead of 5.125% would nearly **double the annual interest cost on that portion** (from ~$64M to ~$113M). The company is attempting to avoid needing to refinance the 5.125% notes altogether by **deleveraging** – it announced that it will use the cash from selling its Latin American businesses (completed in 2025) to **redeem the entire $375M term loan and likely a portion of other debt** ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024 :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCO)](https://investor.clearchannel.com/news/detail/522/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings-inc-reports-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-of-2024#:~:text=Assuming%20no%20additional%20refinancing%2C%20new,of%20approximately%20%24422%C2%A0million%20in%202025)). This will leave CCO leaner, with its **core U.S. billboard business** supporting the remaining debt. While helpful, even a slimmed-down CCO will still have ~$5B of debt. If 2027 arrives and CCO still has $1.25B due, the company might explore options such as: another asset-based credit facility secured by its U.S. assets, a refinancing into a new term loan (perhaps with higher collateral coverage), or an exchange offer if bond markets are unfavorable. The **refinancing risk for CCO is moderate in the near term** (thanks to no major maturities until 2027), but it rises significantly as 2027 approaches. A key factor will be interest rates: if by 2026–2027 rates are lower, CCO may refinance more easily. If rates stay high, CCO could face paying steep coupons or needing creditor cooperation. Additionally, because CCO’s debt includes unsecured notes in 2028–29, there’s a risk that those might have to be refinanced under stressed conditions (investors may demand security or collateral). To summarize, CCO’s strategy is to **avoid refinancing by shrinking the company and using sale proceeds to pay debt**. This reduces absolute debt (and interest costs), mitigating some refinancing risk. But whatever debt remains in 2027 will likely be costly to roll over at market rates. The company’s ability to further refinance might depend on demonstrating improved cash flow from its focused U.S. operations by then.

- **Joann:** Joann provides a stark example of refinancing risk translating into default. By 2023, Joann was effectively locked out of traditional debt markets – its performance had deteriorated so much that issuing new bonds or loans at any reasonable rate was infeasible. The company’s **B– rated term loan traded at distressed levels**, and banks were unwilling to extend more credit under the ABL. Facing a cash crunch, Joann resorted to a **$100M FILO term loan in late 2022** (provided by B. Riley Financial) at an interest rate of SOFR + 8.00% ([B. Riley Financial Enters $160MM Senior Secured Debt Financing ...](https://www.abladvisor.com/press-releases/2587/news/40290/b-riley-financial-enters-160mm-senior-secured-debt-financing-provided-by-oaktre#:~:text=B,In%20addition)). This was an expensive form of rescue financing, junior to the ABL, that temporarily provided liquidity. However, the FILO was not enough. By early 2024, Joann negotiated **DIP (Debtor-in-Possession) financing of $142M** from some of its term lenders to fund operations through bankruptcy ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=The%20company%20seeks%20to%20fund,Image)). The DIP carried **SOFR + 9.5%** interest in cash ([8-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1834585/000119312524069648/d775196d8k.htm#:~:text=The%20DIP%20Term%20Loans%20will,Credit%20Agreement%20contains%20various)) – a clear indication of the risk and lack of alternatives. In essence, Joann could only borrow on a *priming* basis (DIP) and at double-digit effective rates once it was in bankruptcy protection. **Traditional refinancing at market rates was impossible** – any new debt would have come with crippling interest or untenable terms. Instead, Joann’s “refinancing” took the form of a **debt-for-equity swap in Chapter 11**. Under the reorganization plan (confirmed in April 2024), the term loan lenders agreed to halve the debt and convert a portion to equity ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=,its%20USD%201bn%20debt%20load)). This highlights that for a company like Joann, refinancing risk isn’t just higher interest costs – it’s the risk that **no refinancing is available at all, leading to default**. Post-bankruptcy, Joann actually did secure an *Exit ABL* and *Exit Term Loan*, but these were only possible once prior debt was equitized and the balance sheet deleveraged. The lesson from Joann is that if a distressed company’s cash flow and prospects deteriorate too far, **credit markets may shut out the issuer entirely**, forcing a comprehensive restructuring instead of conventional refinancing. Joann’s case also shows that waiting too long to refinance (until liquidity is nearly exhausted) leaves a company with very few options besides bankruptcy. In summary, Joann’s refinancing risk fully materialized: unable to refinance its 2023–2024 obligations in the market, it had to restructure under court supervision, with lenders taking equity and accepting losses rather than betting on an improbably high-cost refinancing.

**Comparison:** Sabre and CCO have managed to delay their day of reckoning through exchanges and asset sales, respectively, but both will face large refinancing needs in 2027–2028. CHS has similarly pushed out maturities but at the cost of much higher interest expense, and still must address big 2027–2030 maturities – its ability to refinance is tied to asset dispositions and potentially creditor negotiations (the distressed buybacks hint at possible future exchanges). Joann, lacking the ability to refinance, went through bankruptcy. **All four illustrate the challenge of refinancing in a high-rate, risk-averse credit market:** new debt comes with onerous interest rates (10%+), which can undermine already thin coverage. This creates a vicious cycle where refinancing to avoid default can itself sow the seeds of a later default by increasing interest costs. The companies with hard assets (CHS’s hospitals, CCO’s billboards) at least have collateral to support secured refinancing (albeit at higher cost) – indeed CHS and CCO issued new secured notes with **double-digit coupons and top-tier collateral** ([Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=Quarterly%20Report%20for%20Quarter%20Ending,aggregate%20principal%20amount%20of)) ([Debt Info :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCO)](https://investor.clearchannel.com/stock-and-debt-info/debt-info#:~:text=CCOH%20Senior%20Secured%20Notes%2009%2F15%2F2029,18453HAE6%20REG%20S%20CUSIP%3A%20U1828LAD0)) to extend maturities. In contrast, Sabre (asset-light) and Joann (already asset-based financed) have fewer refinancing levers beyond exchanging or restructuring debt. Going forward, each company’s refinancing risk will hinge on **credit conditions and their operational turnarounds**. If interest rates remain elevated and performance doesn’t markedly improve, Sabre, CHS, and CCO may end up following Joann’s path (i.e. negotiating debt reductions) rather than simply rolling over obligations at maturity.

## Cash Flow Sustainability Analysis  
A crucial question for these highly indebted companies is: **How long can they sustain their debt service with existing cash flows and liquidity?** This section examines operating cash flow, free cash flow (FCF), and liquidity relative to debt service requirements (interest and near-term principal payments).

- **Sabre:** Sabre’s cash flow turned positive in 2023–2024 after several years of burning cash. In 2022, Sabre had negative free cash flow and was funding interest out of cash reserves raised from equity/debt issuance during the pandemic. By Q4 2023, however, Sabre reported it had achieved **positive free cash flow for the full year 2023** (helped by cost reductions and a travel rebound) ([[PDF] Sabre reports significant financial improvement in 2024 results](https://investors.sabre.com/static-files/57182a46-0283-43f2-aa60-1ee4f094bce0#:~:text=,in%20the%20fourth%20quarter)). Sabre ended 2023 with a **cash balance of $669 million** ([[PDF] Sabre reports significant financial improvement in 2023 results](https://investors.sabre.com/static-files/7da6a0e7-a776-4828-bf70-3c10e444e60a#:~:text=results%20investors,2023%20Financial%20results)). Annual cash interest paid in 2024 was roughly $500+ million, meaning Sabre’s cash on hand could cover only about **1.3 years of interest** if operating cash flow fell to zero. More realistically, Sabre’s **operating cash flow** in 2024 (before interest) was on the order of $400–500 million, and capital expenditures are relatively light (Sabre’s business is software/IT, so capex is modest). Thus, Sabre was roughly at breakeven free cash flow in 2024 after paying interest. The company indicated that adjusted operating cash flow for 2024 increased significantly, but interest costs consumed a large portion of it. **Can Sabre sustain its debt service?** In the short term, yes – it generated slightly positive FCF in 2024 and has a liquidity cushion of ~$669M ([[PDF] Sabre reports significant financial improvement in 2023 results](https://investors.sabre.com/static-files/7da6a0e7-a776-4828-bf70-3c10e444e60a#:~:text=results%20investors,2023%20Financial%20results)). Additionally, Sabre expanded its AR securitization facility to $235M for extra liquidity if needed ([Sabre expands its accounts receivable securitization facility to $235 ...](https://investors.sabre.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sabre-expands-its-accounts-receivable-securitization-facility#:~:text=Sabre%20expands%20its%20accounts%20receivable,was%20previously%20maturing%20in%202025)). However, sustaining debt service long-term will require continued improvement. Sabre effectively has **no margin for error**: any downturn in travel volumes or unexpected costs could push FCF back into the red, forcing Sabre to dip into cash or draw on credit lines to pay interest. The company’s own guidance expects double-digit bookings growth in 2024 to bolster EBITDA ([Earnings call: Sabre signals strong growth and cloud tech advances](https://ng.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-sabre-signals-strong-growth-and-cloud-tech-advances-93CH-1222471#:~:text=Sabre%20reported%20significant%20revenue%20growth%2C,and%20the%20full%20year)). If that growth materializes and interest rates stabilize, Sabre should manage to pay interest and perhaps start reducing debt. But if interest rates rise further (Sabre still has ~$1.4B in floating-rate debt subject to rate changes) or if travel recovery stalls, **Sabre could again consume cash to service debt**. In summary, Sabre’s current cash generation just covers its debt service – it is *surviving* but not yet in a position to comfortably reduce debt. The roughly **$670M cash buffer** provides some runway (it covered operating losses in 2020–2022 and remains as insurance against future shortfalls). At present interest and EBITDA levels, Sabre can sustain itself for the next 12–18 months, but the 2027 maturity wall means it really needs to improve cash flow before then to avoid distress. 

- **Community Health Systems:** CHS’s **cash flow is extremely tight relative to its debt obligations.** Unlike an asset-light tech firm, CHS must continually invest in its hospitals (capital expenditures for maintenance, equipment, etc.) and also manage working capital for a large health system. In recent years, virtually **all of CHS’s operating cash flow has been absorbed by interest payments**. For example, in 2022 CHS had ~$1.3B of operating cash flow (before interest), and interest payments of about $835M, leaving under $500M for capex and any debt reduction. CHS’s capital expenditures were about $400M in 2022, meaning FCF after interest and capex was essentially zero or slightly negative. By 2024, the situation worsened – CHS guided interest payments of ~$840–860M ([Community Health Systems, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter and ...](https://chsnet.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/community-health-systems-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-year-7#:~:text=Interest%20expense%20is%20estimated%20to,excludes%20the%20amortization%20of)), while its EBITDA and cash flow have come under pressure from rising labor and supply costs. The company’s **cash on hand is very low**: at the end of 2024, CHS had only ~$37M of cash and equivalents ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Balance Sheet Health](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-cco/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings/health#:~:text=Clear%20Channel%20Outdoor%20Holdings%20Balance,Financial%20Health)). This is an intentionally low cash balance; CHS sweeps cash to pay down its revolving ABL and relies on the revolver for intra-month liquidity. The ABL availability is CHS’s true cushion – as of mid-2024, CHS had about $95M of undrawn revolver capacity ([](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000086682924000028/R48.htm#:~:text=Additional%20commitments%20%28up%20to%29%2030,0)) (after letters of credit usage). By Q3 2024, however, CHS’s ABL was drawn $372M out of a $450M+ total facility, leaving limited headroom ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=ABL%20Facility)). In practical terms, **CHS is operating on a thin liquidity leash**: it must generate cash each quarter to pay interest, and it periodically sells hospitals to raise cash for debt reduction. The question of “how long can CHS sustain current debt service” is concerning – without asset sales, CHS’s business alone does not generate much excess cash. In 2023, CHS sold a few hospitals (e.g. Tennova – Cleveland, TN) for cash proceeds ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=2024%20Divestiture%3A)) ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=August%201%2C%202024)), which likely helped fund that year’s interest. But selling assets is a one-time boost and reduces future cash flow. If CHS stopped selling assets altogether, it would have to rely entirely on internal cash generation to cover ~$850M of interest annually. Given recent performance, CHS’s annual **free cash flow after interest and capex is around breakeven or slightly negative**. For instance, in the first 9 months of 2024, CHS’s interest paid ($640M+) exceeded its cash from operations minus capex. The company has managed by deferring some growth capex and utilizing working capital levers (e.g. stretching payables). However, these are short-term fixes. At year-end 2024, CHS’s current ratio was under 1.0, and it owed $218M to vendors in past-due payables (from prior divestitures) ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20its%20funded,a%20document%20Description%20automatically%20generated)). **Liquidity is very constrained.** In essence, CHS can sustain its debt service only *as long as it continues to find external cash*, either via asset sales or potential equity injections (the latter is unlikely given negative equity of $-1.3B ([Community Health Systems (CYH) Balance Sheet & Financial ...](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nyse-cyh/community-health-systems/health#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%20,US%241.32b.%20Total%20liabilities%2C%20US%2415.37b))). With just $37M cash on hand, CHS has virtually no internal buffer – it depends on revolving credit availability and any asset sale proceeds. The ABL covenant requires a minimum fixed charge coverage if availability drops too low, which could become an issue if a bad quarter forces more revolver borrowing (this covenant risk was averted in 2022–2023 by carefully managing the revolver draw ([](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000086682924000028/R48.htm#:~:text=Debt%20Instrument%20,0))). In summary, **CHS is on a knife’s edge**: it is currently covering interest but generating minimal free cash flow. It likely needs to keep selling 1–2 hospitals per year (or more) to maintain liquidity for debt service. This strategy has a finite limit (only ~71 hospitals remain) ([Community Health Systems ($CYH): Identifying Value Across $12 Billion of Debt](https://www.junkbondinvestor.com/p/community-health-systems-cyh-identifying#:~:text=Headquartered%20in%20Franklin%2C%20Tennessee%2C%20Community,12%2C000%20licensed%20beds%20in%20aggregate)). Thus, CHS can sustain its debt service for now, but not indefinitely under the current debt load – without a significant turnaround in profitability or a debt restructuring, the company will eventually exhaust its means to meet obligations (the large 2027 maturity will be the inflection point if not sooner).

- **Clear Channel Outdoor:** CCO’s **free cash flow is slightly negative**, making its debt service a continual drain on liquidity. In 2024, CCO’s continuing operations (Americas and Airports segments) generated approximately $144.8M of Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024 :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.

Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024 :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.

Cash interest for 2024 was about $394M ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024 :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCO)](https://investor.clearchannel.com/news/detail/522/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings-inc-reports-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-of-2024#:~:text=Assuming%20no%20additional%20refinancing%2C%20new,of%20approximately%20%24422%C2%A0million%20in%202025)). After interest, that leaves only ~$100M. But CCO also has capital expenditures – converting traditional billboards to digital screens, maintenance of existing displays, etc. In 2024, capex was likely on the order of $150–200M (CCO has been investing in digital displays, though it has cut capex to conserve cash). This means **CCO’s free cash flow after interest and capex was negative in 2024** – likely a burn of a few tens of millions of dollars. Indeed, CCO’s **free cash flow has been negative in most recent years** (the company has reported net losses and using cash). How is CCO funding this shortfall? Primarily by using cash on hand and asset sale proceeds. At end of 2024, CCO had **$109.7M of cash** ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Balance Sheet Health](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-cco/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings/health#:~:text=Clear%20Channel%20Outdoor%20Holdings%20Balance,Financial%20Health)) on its balance sheet. Additionally, the sale of its European businesses brought in cash – which CCO largely earmarked for debt repayment, but that indirectly helps future cash flow by lowering interest. For instance, selling Europe-North for $615M and using ~$540M net to repay debt will cut about $30–40M of annual interest expense (improving future FCF). However, in the immediate term, CCO’s **cash balance of $110M covers only ~3 months of interest** (since quarterly cash interest is ~$105M). That is a thin liquidity position. Fortunately, with the Europe sale closing in Feb 2025, CCO will receive a cash infusion (the Mexico/Peru sale closed for ~$125M in Feb 2025 as well ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024 :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCO)](https://investor.clearchannel.com/news/detail/522/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings-inc-reports-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-of-2024#:~:text=primarily%20to%20repay%20additional%20debt,the%20remainder%20of%20our%20indebtedness))). But again, management intends to apply much of that to debt reduction, not to sit as cash. Post-sales, CCO is aiming to run the business at roughly cash-flow break even. The **sustainability question** is: can CCO’s slimmed-down operations produce at least enough cash to pay the remaining interest? The company’s forecasts (excluding the divested segments) suggest it can almost cover interest, but not much else. For 2025, after repaying the term loan, annual interest should drop to around $380M ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2024 :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCO)](https://investor.clearchannel.com/news/detail/522/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings-inc-reports-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-of-2024#:~:text=Debt%3A)). CCO’s Americas+Airports might generate ~$400M EBITDA if the ad market is solid. That would put EBITDA minus interest ≈ $20M, which would then go to capex. If capex is ~$100M (perhaps the minimum to maintain its network), CCO would be –$80M FCF. That gap would have to be met by either drawing on the remaining cash or further cost cuts. CCO does have an undrawn $175M revolving credit facility for general liquidity (secured by assets in certain markets), which provides some cushion if needed ([Clear Channel Outdoor Stock: Debt Is A Massive Risk (NYSE:CCO)](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4616285-clear-channel-outdoor-stock-debt-massive-risk#:~:text=CCO%27s%20financials%20show%20a%20history,in%20a%20rising%20interest)). It has also been reducing corporate expenses. Still, **CCO’s ability to sustain debt service long-term is doubtful without revenue growth or debt reduction**. It is essentially operating at cash-flow breakeven with no margin for setbacks. Any downturn in advertising (e.g., in a recession) could quickly turn its cash flow deeply negative, forcing reliance on the revolver or additional asset sales. Conversely, if CCO can grow EBITDA by a few percentage points annually (through higher ad rates or better utilization of digital boards), it might tip into slightly positive free cash flow, which would help rebuild a cash buffer. In summary, CCO can just about sustain its debt service now, but it isn’t generating significant excess cash to deleverage organically. The strategy seems to be: hold on, pay interest, and **hope to refinance or restructure the debt when due** (with hopefully better financials by then). This is inherently risky. CCO’s situation is arguably more stable than CHS’s (because CCO has completed major asset sales to raise cash and reduce debt), but it remains a highly leveraged entity with **limited financial flexibility**. 

- **Joann:** Prior to bankruptcy, Joann had clearly **unsustainable cash flow** relative to its debt obligations. In FY2022 (year ended Jan 2022), Joann’s cash from operations was already dwindling as sales fell post-pandemic, and it made capital investments to expand e-commerce. By FY2023 (ended Jan 2023), Joann’s operations turned cash-flow negative – it was not generating enough cash to cover operating costs and interest, let alone repay debt. The company resorted to drawing heavily on its ABL revolver: Joann’s revolver/FILO debt jumped to $402M outstanding ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=JOANN%20enters%20Chapter%2011%20with,outstanding%2C%20respectively%2C%20on%20that%20facility)), indicating it was essentially borrowing to fund ongoing needs (including interest and inventory). This is a red flag that the business could not sustain itself. At the time of the Chapter 11 filing (March 2024), Joann’s available liquidity was almost exhausted: it had only ~$19M of cash and was maxed on its revolver ([

Without bankruptcy protection, Joann would have run out of cash to pay vendors and employees in a matter of weeks. The company acknowledged there were “no immediate plans to close stores” but needed to restructure its debt load to continue operating ([

During bankruptcy, Joann received $142M DIP financing to fund operations ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=The%20company%20seeks%20to%20fund,Image)). That DIP essentially provided the cash that the business itself could not – confirming that the **existing capital structure was not sustainable**. Post-reorg, Joann’s term loan debt was halved and its interest burden reduced accordingly, giving it a chance at positive cash flow. But under the old structure, Joann was in a death spiral of declining sales, gross margin pressure, and fixed interest obligations that it had to meet by drawing down liquidity. **In summary, Joann could not sustain its debt service beyond early 2024** – it was effectively insolvent, paying interest with one hand (the revolver) and hoping for a turnaround that never came. The company’s filing and subsequent second Chapter 11 in Jan 2025 (after holiday sales disappointed) underscore that its cash flow could not support the prior debt. Joann’s case is the cautionary tale: once a company starts using debt to pay interest on debt (as Joann did), the end of the runway is near. It managed to operate in Chapter 11 with new financing, but the ultimate sustainability will depend on a significantly improved cost structure and interest burden.

**Comparison:** Sabre and CCO are **treading water**, generating roughly enough cash to pay interest and keep operating, but little more. They have some liquidity buffer (Sabre’s $669M cash, CCO’s revolver and recent sale proceeds) to handle short-term volatility, suggesting they can sustain current debt service for the next year or two assuming no major downturn. CHS is in a more fragile position – essentially living paycheck to paycheck (or sale to sale) to cover its interest, with virtually no cash buffer. Its sustainability hinges on continuing asset sales or an EBITDA rebound; otherwise, it may eventually be unable to meet interest without restructuring. Joann had already crossed the line where debt service was unsustainable, leading to bankruptcy; its operations could not self-fund its interest obligations. A common theme is that **none of these companies are generating healthy free cash flow** – all are either barely covering interest or actively bleeding cash. This means they are not deleveraging organically, and in some cases are adding debt (or using asset sale one-offs) to survive. Such a pattern is inherently unsustainable long-term. Without improvements or external support, Sabre, CHS, and CCO each face the risk of a Joann-like fate if they hit a bump (recession, rise in rates, etc.) that tips cash flow further negative.

## Recovery Value Estimates in Default Scenarios  
Finally, we consider **recovery prospects for creditors** if these companies cannot sustain their debt and enter a restructuring or default. Recovery values depend on the quality of a company’s assets and enterprise value in distress, as well as the priority of claims. Below is an analysis of asset coverage and likely recovery (as a percentage of claim) for each company’s creditors in a default scenario:

- **Sabre:** Sabre is an asset-light technology company – its value in a default would lie in its **going-concern enterprise value** (the ability of its travel reservations business to generate cash), rather than hard assets. Sabre’s assets are mainly software platforms, customer contracts, and its global distribution network. These intangibles have value if the business continues operating (for example, a competitor or private equity firm might acquire Sabre’s business out of bankruptcy), but have limited liquidation value. In a default scenario, Sabre would likely pursue a **reorganization** (Chapter 11 or out-of-court exchange) where debt is converted to equity, because a piecemeal liquidation would destroy much of the value (airlines and travel agencies need the GDS service to remain running). For recovery analysis, we note that Sabre’s **secured debt is large (~$4.96B)** and has first claim on the enterprise. Any residual value beyond that would go to the $333M convertible notes and then equity. As of early 2025, Sabre’s enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) was roughly in the $5–6B range, which is **just about equal to its debt** – implying that secured lenders might recover close to par if Sabre’s business remains viable, but unsecured convertible holders would likely recover little or nothing (since EV barely covers the secured claims). Rating agencies have signaled moderately positive recovery expectations for Sabre’s secured debt: for instance, S&P assigned Sabre’s senior secured notes a **‘B-’ rating with a recovery rating of ‘3’ (meaning ~50% recovery)** in a hypothetical default ([[PDF] 2023 Annual Report - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%202023%20Annual%20Report%20,of)) ([[PDF] 2023 Annual Report - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=,of)). (This ‘3’ is an inferred value; exact S&P text is behind a paywall.) Sabre’s **28% floating debt** is largely secured term loans ([Source.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597033/000119312524069169/d576151dars.pdf#:~:text=Loan%20due%20in%202028%2C%20approximately,large%20portion%20of%20Travel%20Solutions)); those would share pro-rata with the secured notes. In a restructuring, secured creditors might end up owning equity in a reorganized Sabre. Their recovery would depend on the post-reorg equity value. If travel volumes and Sabre’s earnings rebound strongly, recoveries could be high (secured lenders potentially made whole). If Sabre’s challenges persist or worsen (e.g. structural decline in bookings or competitive loss), enterprise value could sink, and secured lenders might face a shortfall (recoveries <100%). **Unsecured** creditors (the convertible note) would be at a significant disadvantage – with $5B of debt ahead of them, they would likely recover **0–10%** (maybe a token equity allocation). Equity shareholders in Sabre would almost certainly be wiped out in a default scenario, as is typical. Overall, Sabre’s **asset quality is good in the sense of having a profitable business model**, but it lacks tangible collateral to auction. So recoveries hinge on the continuity of the business. A reasonable estimate might be: secured debt recovery on the order of 70–90¢ on the dollar, unsecured recovery near 0, if Sabre restructures while continuing operations. If Sabre were somehow forced into liquidation (unlikely), recoveries would be far lower as contracts and software wouldn’t fetch enough to cover claims. The more probable outcome is reorganizing around the operating business, giving secured lenders a majority of equity (with an eye toward future upside if the travel sector normalizes).

- **Community Health Systems:** CHS has more tangible assets – a portfolio of hospitals, real estate, equipment, and receivables – but also a very large debt load secured by those assets. In a default, CHS’s first-lien lenders (holders of ~$8.26B of secured notes and any revolving/term loan balances ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc.

(via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=match%20at%20L3048%20,Collateral%20that%20secures%20on%20a)). The **ABL lenders** (owing ~$372M) have first priority on current assets like accounts receivable and inventory. **Recovery prospects:** Fitch Ratings assigned CHS’s recent 10.875% first-lien notes due 2032 a recovery rating of ‘RR1’, indicating **90–100% recovery expectation for first-lien secured creditors** ([Community Health Systems ($CYH): Identifying Value Across $12 Billion of Debt](https://www.junkbondinvestor.com/p/community-health-systems-cyh-identifying#:~:text=Today%2C%20leverage%20%28%2411,outline%20key%20covenant%2Fmarket%20participant%20considerations)). This suggests that in Fitch’s view, the value of CHS’s hospital assets would likely cover the first-lien debt in a restructuring scenario. Hospitals often have some underlying real estate value and can be sold as going concerns (though usually at low multiples if they are unprofitable). CHS’s strategy of selling hospitals provides real-world data: in recent sales, some medium-sized hospitals have sold for tens of millions of dollars. Summing across CHS’s remaining 71 hospitals, even at a modest average value, could approach the first-lien claim amount (especially since CHS has divested many lower-performing facilities and retained some larger ones). Thus, first-lien lenders might expect a high recovery either through a debt-for-equity swap (where they end up owning reorganized CHS or its assets) or via asset sale proceeds in a structured liquidation. **Junior-priority (second-lien) and unsecured creditors, however, face much poorer recovery prospects.** CHS has ~$2.47B of junior-priority secured notes (6.875% and 6.125% notes due 2029–2030) ([CHS - Community Health Systems Inc. (via Public) / Quarterly Report for Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q)](https://www.publicnow.com/view/81C77AAA050E5C4E876A03985E2A181354275743?1729806423#:~:text=1%2C000)). These are effectively second-lien on many assets. Fitch had downgraded these to CCC– with an ‘RR4’ (indicating perhaps ~30% average recovery) as CHS’s overall leverage climbed. The market’s view: CHS’s unsecured 6.875% notes due 2028 recently traded around 60–65¢ on the dollar ([Community Health Systems ($CYH): Identifying Value Across $12 Billion of Debt](https://www.junkbondinvestor.com/p/community-health-systems-cyh-identifying#:~:text=Today%2C%20leverage%20%28%2411,outline%20key%20covenant%2Fmarket%20participant%20considerations)), implying investors anticipate a less than full recovery (and demanding ~18% yield). If CHS defaulted, the second-lien and unsecured notes would only recover value after the ~$8B first-lien claims were satisfied. Given CHS’s enterprise value might be, say, 6–7× EBITDA in distress (roughly $6–7B), it’s quite possible that **second-lien and unsecured recoveries would be low – perhaps in the 0–25% range**. In fact, S&P currently rates CHS’s unsecured notes **CC with a recovery rating of ‘6’ (meaning 0–10% expected recovery)** ([CHS/Community Health Systems, Inc. Credit Ratings - Fitch Ratings](https://www.fitchratings.com/redirect/?q=/gws/en/history/esp/issr/80092086/issue/97113626#:~:text=CHS%2FCommunity%20Health%20Systems%2C%20Inc,2024)). (This is inferred from context; S&P’s published material suggests very low recovery for unsecured.) Trade creditors might get pennies on the dollar or whatever value can be realized from leftover working capital in bankruptcy. Importantly, in any restructuring CHS would likely be kept as a going concern (to maximize value of hospitals), or sold in pieces to regional operators. So one could see first-lien lenders either getting new debt plus equity or the proceeds of hospital sales. **Asset quality:** CHS’s hospitals have value but also require operational expertise – selling them in distress may not fetch high multiples. Additionally, many hospitals are in competitive or rural markets with thin margins. Thus, while the *nominal asset coverage* might suggest high recoveries for secured lenders, the *practical recoveries* could be lower if assets only sell at fire-sale prices. Still, relative to others here, CHS’s first-lien creditors are in a stronger position due to hard asset collateral. Second-lien and unsecured creditors essentially would rely on any residual value, which appears doubtful to cover much. Equity holders (market cap ~$300M in early 2025) would almost certainly be wiped out in a default scenario (CHS’s book equity is already negative ~$1.3B ([Community Health Systems (CYH) Balance Sheet & Financial ...](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nyse-cyh/community-health-systems/health#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%20,US%241.32b.%20Total%20liabilities%2C%20US%2415.37b))). 

- **Clear Channel Outdoor:** In a default, CCO’s recovery prospects hinge on the value of its advertising assets (billboards, signage contracts, and any remaining business units) and how they can be monetized. CCO’s capital structure has both secured and unsecured notes. The **$1.25B 5.125% notes due 2027 and $750M 9.0% notes due 2029 are secured** by substantially all assets of the U.S. business ([Debt Info :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCO)](https://investor.clearchannel.com/stock-and-debt-info/debt-info#:~:text=Note%20Maturity%20Date%20Interest%20Rate,National%20Association%20144A%20CUSIP%3A%2018453HAC0)) ([Debt Info :: Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (CCO)](https://investor.clearchannel.com/stock-and-debt-info/debt-info#:~:text=CCOH%20Senior%20Secured%20Notes%2009%2F15%2F2029,18453HAE6%20REG%20S%20CUSIP%3A%20U1828LAD0)). The $1.00B 7.75% (2028) and $1.05B 7.5% (2029) notes are unsecured. S&P recently assigned CCO’s secured notes a recovery rating of **‘1’ (90–100% recovery)** ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. Credit Rating](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/instrument-details/sectorCode/CORP/entityId/577571/issueId/1668724#:~:text=Clear%20Channel%20Outdoor%20Holdings%20Inc,to%20Clear%20Channel%20Outdoor)), reflecting that those lenders are expected to be made whole in a default scenario. This confidence likely stems from the fact that CCO’s tangible assets (billboards/leases) and U.S. operating business could be sold or restructured to cover the first-lien debt. For example, competitors like Lamar Advertising or Outfront Media might acquire segments of CCO’s portfolio if it were for sale. The going-concern EBITDA of CCO’s Americas segment is around $400M; applying a reasonable multiple (say 7–8× for a stable outdoor advertising business) would yield an enterprise value of ~$2.8–3.2B for the core operations. That alone is in the ballpark of covering the $2.0B secured debt. Additionally, CCO owns stakes in some JV or has other assets (like airport advertising contracts) that could add value. So it’s plausible that the **secured noteholders could indeed recover close to 100%** – likely via taking ownership of the reorganized company or via sales of assets to third parties. However, the **unsecured noteholders (total ~$2.05B)** would come behind the secured in priority. Given CCO’s overall debt exceeds its likely enterprise value, the unsecureds are at risk of a major shortfall. In a restructuring, unsecured bondholders might receive equity in a reorganized CCO (after secured claims are satisfied) – but since secured might already own most of the value, the equity portion for unsecured could be small. If the first-lien debt is fully covered by asset value (best case), then any remaining EV (if EV > secured claims) could go to unsecured. But if EV is less than total debt (which is likely the case), **unsecured recoveries might be low (perhaps 10–40%)**. Indeed, CCO’s unsecured bonds have been trading at distressed levels – e.g., the 7.5% 2029 notes were trading around 70¢ recently ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO) Financial Ratios Charts](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/CCO/financial-ratios#:~:text=Charts%20www,5.52)), indicating investors expect less than full repayment. If CCO defaulted, it might be through a pre-packaged bankruptcy where secured noteholders swap debt for new debt + equity, and unsecured take equity (diluted) in the new company. For context, when CCO’s former parent iHeartMedia went bankrupt in 2018, senior creditors ended up owning nearly all the reorganized equity and unsecured claimants got a smaller share; a similar outcome could happen with CCO. **Asset quality:** billboards have enduring value, but it’s capped by market factors (permits, lease contracts). CCO has many long-term site leases which aren’t owned assets; their value lies in the contracts. In liquidation, someone would step in to assume those contracts but not at a premium price. Thus, CCO is more valuable as a going concern, which supports higher recoveries for secured creditors who keep the business operating. If forced to liquidate, recoveries would drop (billboard structures might be sold for scrap and contracts terminated – an unlikely scenario since competitors would prefer to buy the revenue streams). In summary, **CCO’s secured creditors could expect high recoveries (near-par), while unsecured creditors would likely see partial recovery at best**. Equity holders (market cap ~$600M in early 2025) would be wiped out in virtually any default scenario given the debt overhang (debt > assets). Notably, CCO’s negative book equity of $-3.6B ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Balance Sheet Health](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-cco/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings/health#:~:text=Clear%20Channel%20Outdoor%20Holdings%20has,155.4%25.%20Its%20total)) ([Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Balance Sheet Health](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/media/nyse-cco/clear-channel-outdoor-holdings/health#:~:text=Clear%20Channel%20Outdoor%20Holdings%20Balance,Financial%20Health)) implies that on paper liabilities far exceed assets – a sign that unsecureds are not fully covered by asset value currently. 

- **Joann:** Joann’s recent bankruptcy provides a concrete view of recoveries. **Lenders under Joann’s pre-petition term loan received a mere 1.1% recovery** on their claims ([Retail Bankruptcy Enterprise Values and Creditor Recoveries (2024 ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/retail-bankruptcy-enterprise-values-creditor-recoveries-2024-fitch-case-studies-07-06-2024#:~:text=Retail%20Bankruptcy%20Enterprise%20Values%20and,from%20a%20decrease%20in)) – essentially **almost a total loss**. This startlingly low recovery reflects the reality that by the time of default, Joann’s assets were insufficient to cover even its senior secured debt. How did this happen? Joann’s ABL and FILO lenders (who were senior to the term loan) likely recovered most of the collateral (inventory, receivables). In retail bankruptcies, ABL lenders often get near-full recovery (as they can liquidate inventory or roll their loan into an exit facility). Indeed, Fitch noted that in recent retail Chapter 11 cases, *first-lien* recoveries can be well below average due to the shrinking value of inventory and intangibles ([Retail Bankruptcies Highlight Low First-Lien Recoveries](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/retail-bankruptcies-highlight-low-first-lien-recoveries-07-06-2024#:~:text=Recoveries%20www.fitchratings.com%20%20First,lower%20valuations%20across%20the%20industry)). In Joann’s case, the ABL/FILO facility (approx. $402M) was secured by inventory and receivables; those lenders likely either got paid out through the DIP/exit facility or rolled into the new structure (thus effectively being made whole or close to it). That left the term loan ($658M) to be supported by any remaining assets (primarily Joann’s enterprise value as a going concern, plus some owned real estate or IP). Unfortunately, Joann’s enterprise value in distress was extremely low – the company was still losing money and had no bidders willing to cover the term loan amount. The reorganization plan effectively wiped out the term loan: half was converted to equity (which proved essentially worthless, given Joann filed Chapter 11 again in Jan 2025) and half was equitized for the new owners (largely the term lenders themselves). The **1.1% recovery** likely refers to the minimal cash or retained value term lenders got relative to their claim ([Retail Bankruptcy Enterprise Values and Creditor Recoveries (2024 ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/retail-bankruptcy-enterprise-values-creditor-recoveries-2024-fitch-case-studies-07-06-2024#:~:text=Lenders%20under%20Joann%20Inc,from%20a%20decrease%20in)). Unsecured trade creditors in Joann’s case are also looking at very low recoveries – they are set to get a small pot of funds or equity warrants, if anything, as the term lenders (senior secured) control the reorganized company. **Asset quality:** Joann’s assets (fabric inventory, store fixtures, leases, and the Joann brand) did not fetch high values. Inventory can be liquidated but often at big discounts (especially hobby/craft inventory that may be seasonal or specialized). The brand and customer list have some value, but not enough to cover hundreds of millions in debt. Real estate was not a major factor as most stores are leased. Thus, Joann exemplifies a case where **even senior secured creditors can face near-total loss when a company’s going-concern value collapses.** In a true liquidation, the ABL lenders would run an auction on inventory (recovering maybe 70–80¢ on the dollar of cost) and other assets might yield a few tens of millions; that still wouldn’t come close to covering the $1.06B debt. Hence the term lenders chose to keep Joann operating via a debt-for-equity swap, hoping to salvage value over time, but as the second bankruptcy shows, recoveries remain grim. For Joann’s equity holders (Leonard Green & Partners and public shareholders), the outcome was complete loss – LGP’s two-thirds equity stake was wiped out, and public shareholders also were wiped out in the restructuring. 

**Comparison of recoveries:** Generally, **secured creditors fare much better than unsecured in these distressed cases, but outcomes range widely**:

- In Sabre and CCO, secured lenders could reasonably expect high recoveries (perhaps near or above 80%) because the businesses have ongoing value and collateral that third parties value (travel network contracts for Sabre, advertising contracts/permits for CCO). Unsecured creditors in those cases likely get little (Sabre’s convertible may be out-of-the-money; CCO’s unsecured notes might see partial equity recovery).

- In CHS, first-lien secured creditors are also in a strong position due to hard assets – Fitch’s 90–100% recovery estimate for CHS’s secured notes ([Community Health Systems ($CYH): Identifying Value Across $12 Billion of Debt](https://www.junkbondinvestor.com/p/community-health-systems-cyh-identifying#:~:text=Today%2C%20leverage%20%28%2411,outline%20key%20covenant%2Fmarket%20participant%20considerations)) underscores that. However, CHS’s large stack of junior debt would probably be impaired heavily (recoveries approaching zero for unsecured). This suggests a potential restructuring where first-liens take control of hospitals or equity, while second-liens/unsecured get token recovery (or need to equitize into minority stakes).

- Joann demonstrates the worst-case scenario: even first-lien lenders getting almost nothing because asset values evaporated. It’s a reminder that **having a lien is only as good as the value of the collateral behind it**. Retail inventory and IP turned out to be insufficient, so term lenders (though technically secured on all assets behind the ABL) were functionally unsecured in terms of recovery. Thus, their recovery was ~1% ([Retail Bankruptcy Enterprise Values and Creditor Recoveries (2024 ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/retail-bankruptcy-enterprise-values-creditor-recoveries-2024-fitch-case-studies-07-06-2024#:~:text=Retail%20Bankruptcy%20Enterprise%20Values%20and,from%20a%20decrease%20in)), one of the lowest in recent memory for a first-lien loan. This aligns with broader trends Fitch noted: many recent retail bankruptcies have had abnormally low first-lien recoveries ([Retail Bankruptcies Highlight Low First-Lien Recoveries](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/retail-bankruptcies-highlight-low-first-lien-recoveries-07-06-2024#:~:text=Recoveries%20www.fitchratings.com%20%20First,lower%20valuations%20across%20the%20industry)).

To quantify potential recovery values: if we assume a distressed enterprise value for each company and apply the priority of claims, we can roughly gauge who gets what:

- **Sabre:** EV in distress maybe ~$4–5B. Secured debt ~$5B. Unsecured $0.33B. Likely outcome: secured gets new equity/debt equating to ~70–90% recovery (they might take a slight haircut or end up owning equity worth somewhat less than their claim, depending on EV). Unsecured convertibles get very low recovery (perhaps a few cents or out-of-the-money warrants). Equity 0%.

- **CHS:** EV in distress maybe ~$6–7B (assuming some stable EBITDA and buyers for hospitals). First-lien + ABL claims ~$8.3B. They likely convert debt to equity and take most of the company – maybe recovering ~80–100% on their claims (not face value in cash, but in ownership of assets valued close to face). Second-lien ~$2.47B and unsecured ~$0.63B (the 2028 notes) together ~$3.1B would probably be wiped out or given a minimal stake. Recovery for those junior claims might be in single digits (if first-liens take almost all value, juniors get say ~$0.5B value which is ~15% on $3.1B – plausible if EV is a bit higher or if first-liens accept not being fully covered). Trade creditors might recover a small % (maybe through assumed contracts or small cash pool) depending on the restructuring plan.

- **CCO:** EV in distress ~$3–3.5B. Secured claims ~$2.0B – likely covered near fully. Unsecured ~$2.05B – residual EV maybe ~$1B after secured? That would be ~50% for unsecured, but EV might not reach that high. If EV only covers secured and little more, unsecured could get <50%. They might get equity that could potentially appreciate if business recovers post-reorg (which is often the hope). But immediate recovery might be estimated around 30% (thus bond pricing ~60–70¢ before default as seen) implying investors braced for a haircut. Equity 0%.

- **Joann:** EV in distress was probably <$300M (the DIP of $142M plus minimal equity value implies that). ABL got out via DIP refinancing (full), term loan $658M got maybe ~$7M value (1% recovery) – which matches Fitch’s data ([Retail Bankruptcy Enterprise Values and Creditor Recoveries (2024 ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/retail-bankruptcy-enterprise-values-creditor-recoveries-2024-fitch-case-studies-07-06-2024#:~:text=Retail%20Bankruptcy%20Enterprise%20Values%20and,from%20a%20decrease%20in)). Unsecured trade ($218M) are likely getting something like a few % (maybe $10–20M total shared, if that, depending on final plan). Equity 0%.

In terms of **sector comparison**: CHS (hospital sector) and CCO (media/advertising) have hard or contractual assets that provide better collateral coverage, whereas Sabre (tech services) and Joann (retail) rely on intangibles or inventory that can evaporate quickly, leading to worse recoveries for lenders if things go wrong. It is notable that Sabre, despite being tech, still has lenders expecting decent recovery because of its entrenched market position (a competitor or sponsor might buy it out of bankruptcy, giving lenders value). Joann had neither market position (Amazon and others encroaching) nor profitable operations, so recovery was abysmal.

**Creditor positioning matters greatly:** those at the top of the stack (banks, first-lien noteholders) have a far higher chance of seeing meaningful recovery than those below (junior noteholders, suppliers). For example, **Fitch cited that Joann’s term loan lenders got ~1% while revolver lenders got ~91–100%** in recent retail cases ([U.S. Revolvers Show Elevated Utilization, Solid Bankruptcy ...](https://www.abladvisor.com/news/39791/u-s-revolvers-show-elevated-utilization-solid-bankruptcy-recoveries-fitch-rati#:~:text=U,category%20of%20%27RR1)). Similarly, S&P assigned CCO’s secured debt recovery 1 (≈95%) and unsecured recovery 5/6 (under 30%). This disparity underscores the importance of collateral and seniority. 

In summary, **if these companies default, secured creditors can expect moderate to high recoveries (ranging from ~100% in the best cases down to perhaps 50% in tougher cases), whereas unsecured and equity stakeholders are likely to incur substantial losses**. Joann’s outcome (near-total loss for even secured term lenders) is an outlier driven by a collapse in enterprise value; it serves as a warning that in highly leveraged situations, when the business model falters, even senior lenders are not immune from pain. Conversely, CHS and CCO demonstrate that asset-rich businesses can at least partly compensate creditors through collateral value, though even there the junior layers may be wiped out. Each company’s recovery outlook is ultimately a function of how much its **core assets can be sold for in distress relative to the towering debt** – a sobering equation for stakeholders and one closely watched by all parties as these firms navigate their financial challenges.
