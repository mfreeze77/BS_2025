# High-Upside “Big Short” Strategy Roadmap

## 1. Target Sectors & Instruments 
Identifying vulnerable sectors is crucial. We target areas with **extreme leverage, floating-rate debt exposure, or frothy valuations** that the market underestimates: 

- **Over-Leveraged Corporate Credit (Junk Bonds & Leveraged Loans)** – Companies with heavy debt loads and thin interest coverage are prime short candidates. Many “zombie” firms barely cover interest payments; about 35% of non-financial companies globally had EBIT-to-interest ratios below 1 in 2023 ([Rising Interest Rates Increasingly Threaten Zombie Companies Globally ](https://www.creditriskmonitor.com/resources/blog-posts/rising-interest-rates-increasingly-threaten-zombie-companies-globally#:~:text=Persistent%20inflation%20and%20higher%20interest,wave%20of%20new%20bankruptcy%20filings)). These highly leveraged borrowers thrived on low rates and covenant-lite loans. Now, with rates up, even **Fitch** forecasts U.S. leveraged loan defaults to jump to ~5% in 2024 as **heavily indebted companies struggle with rising interest costs** ([Fitch Raises US Loan Default Rate Forecast to 5%-5.5% in 2024](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/fitch-raises-us-loan-default-rate-forecast-to-5-5-5-in-2024#:~:text=Image%3A%20Email%20Natalie%20Harrison)). Short positions can target high-yield bond ETFs (e.g. short **HYG** or **JNK**) or loan ETFs (like **BKLN**), as well as buying credit default swaps (CDS) on **junk bond indexes** or specific weak issuers. We can also consider shorting lower-rated **CLO tranches** (mezzanine or equity pieces of Collateralized Loan Obligations) that are exposed if underlying loan defaults surge. These instruments bundle leveraged loans (usually floating-rate), and while senior CLO tranches are cushioned, the junior tranches could see outsized losses. *Covenant-lite* loans – now the norm – mean fewer lender protections, and historically **cov-lite loans recover only ~68% of par on average vs ~79% for covenanted loans**, implying bigger losses in default scenarios ([Settling For Less: Covenant-Lite Loans Have Lower Recoveries ...](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/201013-settling-for-less-covenant-lite-loans-have-lower-recoveries-higher-event-and-pricing-risks-11687612#:~:text=Settling%20For%20Less%3A%20Covenant,lien)). Buying CDS protection on a BBB or BB-rated CLO tranche (or shorting a CLO ETF if available) is an esoteric but potent “big short” style trade if corporate defaults spike.

- **Commercial Real Estate (CRE), Especially Offices** – The office sector combines high leverage with secular headwinds (remote work, occupancy declines). Property values are under pressure from **higher cap rates and looming debt refinancings**. In fact, U.S. commercial real estate faces a *“maturity wall”* of roughly **$2 trillion of loans coming due 2024–2026** ([The looming maturity wall - Private Debt Investor](https://www.privatedebtinvestor.com/the-looming-maturity-wall/#:~:text=Investor%20www,to%20research%20by%20advisory%20Newmark)), many taken at low rates and now facing refinancing at double-digit yields. Short opportunities include shorting overextended **office REIT stocks** (which still trade above the likely intrinsic value of their properties), buying protection via **CMBS indexes** (like shorting certain CMBX series tied to office mortgages), or shorting CRE-focused high-yield debt. The idea is that as loans mature or reset to higher floating rates, distressed sales and defaults will hammer equity values and lower-tier debt. For example, one could **short an index of commercial mortgage-backed securities** or buy puts on an ETF of REITs. This trade is not crowded because many investors still assume offices will “rebound,” underpricing the risk of a deeper correction. (That said, timing is tricky – shorting real estate has been dubbed the “widowmaker” by traders who were right eventually but bled carry costs waiting ([Why Wall Street Cowboys Believe the Next Big Short Is on Offices](https://therealdeal.com/magazine/national-may-2023/real-estates-next-big-short-is-so-risky-its-called-the-widowmaker/#:~:text=Had%20he%20been%20able%20to,trade%20would%20have%20reaped%20riches)).)

- **Overhyped Equity Bubbles Tied to Cheap Money** – Certain stocks and sectors with *unsustainable valuations* can be targeted, especially where fundamentals may crack in a higher-rate or consumer-weakened environment. Candidates include companies that benefited from the zero-rate era but carry high debt or fragile business models. For instance, highly leveraged **retailers or consumer product firms** that boomed on stimulus but now see falling discretionary spending. As rates bite consumers, sectors like specialty retail, travel, or durable goods could see revenue drop, hurting indebted players. **Consumer credit is at record highs** (U.S. household debt hit $18.1 trillion in 2024 ([Consumer Spending | U.S. Bank](https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/consumer-spending.html#:~:text=Debt%20funds%20an%20increasing%20proportion,4))), and if spending pulls back, earnings for these firms will fall while their interest expense rises. Another angle is shorting richly valued **growth/tech stocks that rely on external financing** – some loss-making tech firms or speculative EV startups, for example, may struggle as capital dries up. You can use **put options on an innovation ETF** or selectively short individual names that have sky-high multiples despite cash burn. While equity shorts are more common, the key is focusing on those with hidden leverage or credit risk (e.g. high-yield debt outstanding) which the market may be ignoring. This way the short thesis has a catalyst (need to refinance debt or raise cash) rather than purely betting on valuation contraction.

By concentrating on these under-appreciated trouble spots – heavily indebted corporates, debt-laden real estate, and bubble valuations vulnerable to tightening liquidity – we assemble a target list akin to how “The Big Short” investors hunted underestimated mortgage risks.

## 2. Timeline & Catalyst Events 
Our strategy maps out **short-term versus long-term setups** to capitalize on both immediate stress points and the broader credit cycle turn:

**Short-Term (Next 2–6 Months):** We anticipate several catalyst events that could rapidly reprice these vulnerable assets: 
- **Interest Rate Shock or Liquidity Crunch:** With inflation lingering, central banks could stay “higher for longer” on rates. Any surprise **rate hikes or signals of prolonged tightening** can trigger a sell-off in rate-sensitive sectors. For instance, if the Fed or ECB indicates more tightening, highly leveraged loan issuers may suddenly face prohibitive refinancing costs. Similarly, if short-term funding markets tighten (as seen briefly during regional bank turmoil), credit spreads could jump overnight. A related catalyst is the removal of liquidity – e.g. central bank QT or a surge in Treasury issuance pushing up yields. In the next few months, even **stable policy but high prevailing rates** will continue squeezing borrowers with floating-rate debt as quarterly interest payments come due, potentially leading to earnings misses or minor defaults that spook markets.
- **Earnings & Consumer Spending Deterioration:** We’ll be watching upcoming earnings seasons for **signs of consumer pullback or margin compression**. High-frequency data in retail and services might show a demand slowdown as excess savings fade and credit card balances hit records. Companies reliant on consumer spending (retailers, travel, discretionary goods) could warn of weaker sales. A notable earnings miss or guidance cut from a bellwether retailer, for example, could catalyze a sharp drop in that stock and its peers. Additionally, if **consumer credit delinquencies tick up** (credit card and auto loan defaults have begun rising off historic lows ([Household Debt and Credit Report](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc#:~:text=Household%20Debt%20and%20Credit%20Report,As))), it could signal the turn of the credit cycle, causing investors to reassess risk across high-yield consumer-facing bonds.
- **Isolated Blowups or Rating Downgrades:** In the near term, even isolated credit events can be catalysts. We look for any **large corporate bankruptcy or a wave of distressed debt exchanges**. For instance, if a prominent highly leveraged company (say in telecom or media) seeks restructuring, it could widen spreads in its sector. **Fitch’s watchlist** already flags names like Altice (telecom) as at risk of distressed exchanges ([Fitch Raises US Loan Default Rate Forecast to 5%-5.5% in 2024](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/fitch-raises-us-loan-default-rate-forecast-to-5-5-5-in-2024#:~:text=,4)). A major downgrade of a big issuer from investment grade to junk (a fallen angel) would flood the HY market with supply and could be a trigger for re-pricing risk. Any such event in the next 2–6 months would validate the short thesis and likely produce quick gains on our positions.

**Long-Term (12–24 Months):** Over a one- to two-year horizon, we foresee a broader unwinding of the credit excesses, akin to the slow burn that led up to 2008. Key catalysts on this timeline include: 
- **Cumulative Rate Impact & Recession Odds:** By 12–24 months out, the full impact of 2022–2023’s rate hikes will hit the economy. Borrowers who locked in low rates are gradually forced to refinance at much higher yields as debts mature. A huge volume of corporate debt comes due in 2025–2026 (the “maturity wall”), which will test weaker firms. If economic growth slows or a mild **recession** hits in this window (as many expect by mid-2025), default rates could really accelerate. Even **S&P forecasts** U.S. speculative-grade default rates around 4% by mid-2025 in a base case, but in a pessimistic scenario defaults could far exceed that ([Yield trumps spread in the great high yield debate | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/yield-trumps-spread-great-high-yield-debate-quaglia-2025-01-27/#:~:text=The%20U,level%20is%20near%20the%20average)). A recession would be the overarching catalyst that causes the “house of cards” to fall – consumers cut back, earnings fall, and heavily indebted companies default in clusters.
- **Corporate Credit Stress & Default Wave:** As a consequence of the above, we anticipate a **wave of corporate distress** unfolding over 2024–2026. Sectors with the worst leverage (think private-equity-owned firms, certain real estate developers, highly levered telecom/media companies) will start hitting the wall. The catalyst here is simply the inability to roll over debt or the breaching of whatever covenants remain. We might see multiple defaults in high-yield bonds and loans, pushing the default rate to multi-year highs. Notably, **Moody’s and Fitch have warned** of default risks climbing to post-Global Financial Crisis highs ([Fitch Raises US Loan Default Rate Forecast to 5%-5.5% in 2024](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/fitch-raises-us-loan-default-rate-forecast-to-5-5-5-in-2024#:~:text=Image%3A%20Email%20Natalie%20Harrison)). When this wave materializes, likely over the next two years, it validates shorts on HY bonds, CLO tranches, and vulnerable equities – these could yield outsized payoffs as prices gap down on each default announcement.
- **Real Estate Crunch Deepening:** In commercial real estate, the long-term catalyst is the **refinancing cliff** – many loans will either default or require equity infusions. By 2025, as that ~$2 trillion in CRE debt matures ([The looming maturity wall - Private Debt Investor](https://www.privatedebtinvestor.com/the-looming-maturity-wall/#:~:text=Investor%20www,to%20research%20by%20advisory%20Newmark)), we expect to see *fire sales* of properties, major valuation write-downs by REITs, and even bank losses on CRE loans. A high-profile office landlord defaulting on mortgages or a significant decline in national CRE prices (reports of offices trading at 50% of pre-pandemic value in some cities) could be the tipping point. This would hammer CMBS and related equities, making our shorts on those pay off. The timeline for real estate stress is longer because lenders often extend terms, but pressure will build steadily into 2025–2026, meaning patience on those shorts could be rewarded with a sudden collapse in asset values once extensions run out.

In sum, the short-term trades bank on sentiment shifts and early tremors (rate surprises, earnings misses, single-company blowups), while long-term trades target the **inevitable credit downturn** as debt burdens become unsustainable. We structure the strategy to profit from quick hits (e.g. an ETF put surging on a bad earnings season) but also to be positioned for the “big one” – a broad repricing of credit risk over the next 1–2 years as the cycle turns.

## 3. High-Risk, High-Reward Opportunities 
This strategy emphasizes **asymmetric payoff setups** – where downside is limited but upside (payout) could be multiples if our thesis plays out. Like the original “Big Short” bets, we seek trades the market isn’t fully pricing in:

 ([image]()) *U.S. high-yield credit spreads have recently narrowed to levels last seen in 2007, indicating investors are being paid very little extra yield for taking on junk credit risk ([Yield trumps spread in the great high yield debate | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/yield-trumps-spread-great-high-yield-debate-quaglia-2025-01-27/#:~:text=The%20U,level%20is%20near%20the%20average)). Such historically tight spreads reflect complacency ([US credit spreads narrow to new lows as economy looks up | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/us-credit-spreads-narrow-new-lows-economy-looks-up-2024-10-11/#:~:text=Still%2C%20he%20said%20there%20was,sharper%20economic%20slowdown%20than%20anticipated)) – an ideal scenario to position for an outsized payoff if conditions deteriorate.* 

- **Shorting Credit at Complacent Pricing:** The extreme tightness in credit spreads (near record lows in late 2024) means buying protection is cheap relative to potential payouts. For example, high-yield bond spreads around **260 bps (almost the 1st percentile historically) in early 2025** ([Yield trumps spread in the great high yield debate | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/yield-trumps-spread-great-high-yield-debate-quaglia-2025-01-27/#:~:text=The%20U,level%20is%20near%20the%20average)) imply that investors are very sanguine about defaults. This creates an asymmetric opportunity: one can pay a modest premium for protection (via CDS or put options on HYG) and potentially gain many times that if spreads blow out to, say, 600–800+ bps in a crisis. We saw a similar setup in 2007 when spreads were microscopically thin right before the storm. Now, few expect a major default wave – that skepticism is exactly what makes the **risk/reward skew attractive**. A **CDX High Yield index CDS** contract, for instance, might cost only a few hundred basis points annually; if a recession hits, that index could widen dramatically, making the CDS contracts skyrocket in value (yields on junk bonds can jump to double-digits, handing big gains to protection buyers). In other words, we risk a small premium (carry cost) but stand to gain **5×, 10× or more** if the credit cycle turns sharply.

- **Equity Puts on Overvalued, Debt-Dependent Companies:** Another asymmetric trade is **long-dated put options** on companies or sectors that could implode under financial stress. Buying puts limits your loss to the premium paid, yet if the stock collapses, the put’s value can increase exponentially. We focus on names where downside could be essentially a wipeout (bankruptcy or massive restructuring) – e.g. a retailer with too much debt that could go to $0 – but which the market still values as a going concern. If such a company hangs on for a year, we lose the premium; but if it files Chapter 11, a far out-of-the-money put could easily become deep in the money (a 10¢ option can go to $10 in an extreme case, a 100× payoff). These opportunities often arise in **high-yield equity names** that haven’t yet crashed. The broader market might be pricing them as “distressed but survivable,” whereas our analysis says otherwise. By purchasing **put spreads or leap puts** on a basket of these weak links, we risk small amounts on each for the chance at huge gains on the few that truly blow up. It’s a classic venture-capital style distribution (many small losses, a few home-run wins) applied to shorting.

- **CDS on Individual Companies or Tranches:** In the spirit of Michael Burry’s swaps on subprime CDOs, we can use **credit default swaps** to bet against specific corporate credits or tranches of structured products. **CDS contracts offer highly asymmetric payoffs**: you pay a quarterly premium (like insurance); if the company defaults, the CDS pays out the difference between par and recovery. For example, consider a shaky single-B rated company’s 5-year CDS trading at 500 bps (5% per year). If the company avoids default for 5 years, you lose ~25% in premiums – not trivial, but not catastrophic. However, if it defaults in a messy restructuring, a CDS could pay out close to 100% (if the bonds recover, say, only 20¢ on the dollar, the CDS payout is 80¢). That’s a 3-to-1 payoff ratio even if default odds are moderate. We’d target **companies with high leverage and looming maturities** – where we see, say, a 50% chance of default that the market handicaps at only 10%. Similarly, we could buy CDS on the **lower tranches of a CLO** structure. Those mezzanine tranches (BBB/BB) are currently viewed as safe-ish (tight spreads) due to historically low default rates on loans, but if defaults surge, they could take losses. The cost to insure them now is low, but the payout if 5–10% of loans default could be huge (since the equity and lower debt tranches would get wiped out). Such trades are complex and not crowded – the big money is mostly selling protection (for yield) rather than buying it – so we are on the opposite side of a complacent consensus.

Overall, these **high-risk, high-reward plays are “asymmetric”** in that the most we can lose is predefined (the option premium, the CDS premium, or the borrow cost on a short), while the potential gain if our thesis is right could be an order of magnitude larger. The market is not fully pricing in scenarios like a credit crisis or a consumer retrenchment – we aim to occupy those out-of-consensus trades. It’s exactly when “everyone” thinks an asset is safe (or a bubble will keep inflating) that betting on the downside is cheapest and most profitable. Our roadmap is essentially to buy insurance on financial sins that have yet to be punished, with a payoff structure that massively favors the diligent contrarian.

## 4. Sophisticated Trading Approaches 
Executing these ideas requires the right instruments. We’ll use a **toolkit of advanced short-selling techniques**, each suited to a different target and risk appetite:

- **Buying Put Options:** Purchasing put options (especially long-dated ones) is a straightforward way to bet on price declines while capping risk. For instance, to short high-yield bonds, we could buy **puts on HYG or JNK ETFs**. If credit spreads blow out, these ETFs will fall and the puts can yield large gains. The advantage of puts is **limited downside** – if the thesis doesn’t play out by option expiry, our loss is just the premium. They also provide leverage; a small premium controls a larger notional position. We’ll use **LEAP puts (1-2 years out)** for long-term themes (e.g. deep OTM puts on an overvalued stock or on a sector ETF like retail or small-caps) so that we have time for the thesis to materialize. For short-term catalysts, nearer-term options or tactical put spreads (to offset cost) can be utilized around specific event dates (e.g. buy puts expiring after the next Fed meeting or earnings season). One must manage volatility and time-decay – ideally we buy puts when implied vol is low (e.g. during market calm) to get them cheaply.

- **Short Selling Equities/ETFs:** Traditional shorting (borrowing shares to sell now and buy back later at hopefully lower prices) will be used selectively for targets without good options or for longer-term positioning beyond option expiries. For example, shorting individual **zombie company stocks** or **overstretched REITs** can be effective. We might short an ETF like **Russell 2000 (IWM)** to broadly short highly indebted small-caps, or an index of homebuilders if we expect housing to crack. Direct shorting provides continuous exposure (no expiration) but comes with **risks: unlimited loss potential, margin costs, and possible short squeezes**. We’ll mitigate these by sizing positions modestly and focusing on names with sufficient float (to avoid getting squeezed by a low-liquidity spike). We also monitor borrow fees; if borrow costs rise (a sign the short is crowded), we may shift to puts instead. In some cases, we can use **inverse ETFs or total return swaps** to replicate a short position synthetically, which can simplify execution and limit squeeze risk.

- **Credit Default Swaps (CDS):** For the credit instruments, **entering CDS contracts** is a primary tactic – akin to how Burry bought CDS on subprime CDO tranches. Through a dealer, we can buy protection on specific corporate bonds (or on indexes like **CDX HY** for a broad bet). CDS are sophisticated instruments typically for institutional players; they require the ISDA agreements, etc. But they offer direct exposure to default risk. A *CDS on a company* is effectively a short position on that company’s credit – if the company’s perceived credit risk rises (widening CDS spread) or it defaults, our CDS position gains value (we could sell it at a higher price or collect a default payout). We must commit to paying the quarterly premium, which is the “negative carry” for the trade. Timing matters because paying too many quarters of premium will eat into returns (as Michael Burry experienced while waiting). Nonetheless, for a 12–24 month view on a looming default wave, buying a **basket of CDS on vulnerable issuers** is a potent approach. Likewise, we can use **index CDS** (like buying protection on *LCDX*, an index of leveraged loans, or specialized tranches of CDX that mimic mezzanine risk) to short entire sectors. One *accessible workaround* for some investors is buying **put options on corporate bond ETFs (e.g. put on a BBB-rated corporate bond ETF for an IG short)**, which isn’t a true CDS but captures credit spread widening via the ETF’s price drop.

- **Synthetic Shorts & Structured Products:** We can get creative by structuring positions that profit from declines without outright shorting. For example, constructing a **put spread collar**: buy a put at one strike, finance it by selling a deeper OTM put (limiting max gain) or selling a call. This lowers net premium and still gives downside exposure – useful if options are pricey. Another approach is using **futures or forwards** to short credit indices (if available) or using **swaptions** (options on interest rate swaps) to bet on widening yield spreads. For instance, an interest rate swaption could be structured to pay off if corporate bond yields jump relative to Treasury yields. We might also use **pair trades** as synthetic shorts: e.g. long a safe asset, short a risky asset, so that we profit if the risky underperforms. An example would be **long Treasury bonds vs short high-yield bonds** – if credit spreads widen (junk underperforms Treasuries), the trade gains, largely isolating the credit risk. These sophisticated structures help manage specific risks (like isolating credit spread moves from pure interest rate moves). We will evaluate **liquidity and counterparty risk** for each instrument – e.g. CDS and swaps entail counterparty exposure, so we spread trades among major banks to mitigate any single failure risk (remote, but we plan thoroughly).

Each tool has its pros and cons. **Options** are easier for timing and limiting loss, **CDS** give pure-play access to credit events, **shorting** is simple but dangerous if done incautiously, and **structured trades** can fine-tune exposure. We’ll likely deploy a *combination* – for instance, buy CDS on indexes for the long-term credit crash view, but use equity puts for quick hits around consumer spending data. This multi-pronged approach ensures we capture the full spectrum of the short thesis in a risk-balanced way.

## 5. Execution & Risk Management 
A brilliant trade thesis can fail simply due to poor execution or risk control (many “Big Short” players barely survived long enough to see the payday). We therefore detail execution tactics and hedges to **maximize profits while surviving the path there**:

- **Optimal Entry Points:** We plan to initiate short positions during periods of **market optimism and tight spreads** – essentially, when our target assets are overpriced and protection is cheap. For example, if high-yield bond spreads tighten to extreme lows again, that’s a green light to load up on puts or CDS (as we did when spreads hit ~289 bps, a 17-year low ([US credit spreads narrow to new lows as economy looks up | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/us-credit-spreads-narrow-new-lows-economy-looks-up-2024-10-11/#:~:text=Spreads%20in%20the%20ICE%20BofA,LSEG%20data%20on%20Friday%20showed))). Best entry often means enduring a bit of euphoria – we might start scaling into shorts when “everyone” else is bullish and asset prices are at highs. It’s important not to short *too early* though. We use technical and sentiment indicators to avoid premature entry: e.g. wait for a blow-off top or a specific catalyst on the horizon. If a catalyst is known (say an upcoming Fed meeting or debt maturity), we might initiate a position shortly before when option prices are still reasonable. Essentially, **leg into positions gradually**, rather than all at once, to average in at good levels. 

- **Position Sizing and Diversification:** High-upside shorts can be volatile and have carry costs, so we size each position such that we can sustain adverse moves. No single short will be so large that a squeeze or a temporary spike against us forces an exit. We diversify across **different trades and sectors** – some consumer, some credit, some real estate – to spread risk. This way, even if one sector takes longer to crack, others might pay off sooner. Each individual name we short (via equity or CDS) will be a small percent of the portfolio, recognizing that idiosyncratic surprises happen (e.g. a buyout offer could make a heavily shorted stock jump 50% overnight – painful if oversized). By keeping position sizes moderate, we ensure no single mistake is fatal.

- **Monitoring and Catalyst Tracking:** Risk management also means **staying on top of developments**. We will continuously monitor key metrics like corporate **earnings, interest coverage ratios, default rates, and economic data**. If facts change for a target (say a company miraculously delevers or refinances out a few years, buying itself time), we’ll re-evaluate and possibly cut that short. We’ll also watch market technicals: if put options get very expensive (implied vol spikes), it might be better to take profits or roll to a later date rather than overpay for protection. In essence, we actively manage the short book, taking partial profits on spikes (because even in a downtrend, violent bear-market rallies can occur). For instance, if a recession officially hits and our junk bond puts triple in value due to a volatility surge, we might trim some position – both to lock gains and to have dry powder to re-enter if spreads briefly tighten on a relief rally.

- **Hedging Tail Risks:** While our strategy is net short, we can **hedge certain risks to smooth the ride**. One risk is that central banks might cut rates or restart easing if faced with crisis – paradoxically, that could cause a short-term rally in junk bonds or stocks (even if fundamentals are bad). To hedge this, we might go **long some Treasury bonds or interest rate futures** as a partial offset – if a recession causes the Fed to slash rates, Treasuries would rally (profit on hedge) even as credit spreads widen (profit on main trade). Another hedge is **pairs trading**: for example, short a weak company and *long a strong competitor* to isolate the idiosyncratic collapse risk. If we short a basket of overleveraged retail stocks, we might go long a stable consumer staples stock as a mild offset (so if the whole market rallies, our longs cushion the blow, while if only the weak names collapse, the longs hold value). We can also use **stop-loss levels** on certain trades to cap downside – though with shorts, stops can be tricky (you don’t want to be stopped out at a temporary top). Instead of hard stops, we may use **options as built-in stops** (since a put can only go to zero). Crucially, we’ll hedge the **timing risk** by staggered maturities: some short positions that expire or realize gains in early 2025, others in late 2025, etc., so that not everything hinges on one specific timing.

- **Managing Carry and Squeeze Risk:** Shorting can incur negative carry – option premiums paid, borrow fees, CDS spreads paid quarterly. We account for these in our budgeting. The strategy is high-reward, but we must *survive the wait*. For trades with significant carry cost (like CDS), we limit the size so that the **total carry cost per quarter is manageable** (like an insurance premium we’re willing to pay for the portfolio). If at any point the thesis seems delayed, we might reduce positions to cut carry drain. We’re also vigilant about **short squeezes** – if a particular stock becomes a meme or target of a squeeze, we won’t battle irrational buyers; we’ll cover and reposition via puts (so we can’t be squeezed) or shift to a less crowded target. The goal is to not get forced out of good trades. We’ve learned from past short sellers who were “right but early” – like the fund that **shorted malls via CMBX but had to fold before the trade paid off** ([Why Wall Street Cowboys Believe the Next Big Short Is on Offices](https://therealdeal.com/magazine/national-may-2023/real-estates-next-big-short-is-so-risky-its-called-the-widowmaker/#:~:text=Half%20a%20decade%20ago%2C%20Yip%E2%80%99s,and%20shut%20the%20fund%20down)). Our risk management is designed to avoid that fate. We maintain ample liquidity and low leverage on our side, so we can hold positions through volatility.

In conclusion, this short-selling roadmap – inspired by *“The Big Short”* playbook – combines rigorous sector analysis with savvy trade construction and disciplined risk control. We target pockets of hidden risk (extreme leverage, floating-rate exposure, and overvaluation) that most of the market hasn’t yet fully appreciated. By deploying tools like puts, CDS, and strategic shorts, we position for **asymmetric payoffs** if and when these vulnerabilities unravel. We’ve aligned our timelines with catalysts on the horizon and built in hedges and sizing rules to weather the uncertainty. Should the anticipated credit storm hit, this multi-faceted short strategy aims to generate substantial profits much like the original Big Short – while carefully navigating the high stakes involved in betting against consensus. Each element – what to short, when to short, how to short, and how to manage the trade – has been crafted with deep financial analysis and foresight, giving us a sophisticated edge in pursuing high-upside returns on the coming market downturn. 

**Sources:** Key data and insights have been drawn from market research and analysts. For instance, Fitch Ratings highlighted rising default risks as interest costs climb ([Fitch Raises US Loan Default Rate Forecast to 5%-5.5% in 2024](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/fitch-raises-us-loan-default-rate-forecast-to-5-5-5-in-2024#:~:text=Image%3A%20Email%20Natalie%20Harrison)), and Newmark research quantified the looming $2 trillion CRE refinance wave ([The looming maturity wall - Private Debt Investor](https://www.privatedebtinvestor.com/the-looming-maturity-wall/#:~:text=Investor%20www,to%20research%20by%20advisory%20Newmark)). Extremely tight credit spreads (near 2007 levels) have been noted by Reuters and credit strategists ([Yield trumps spread in the great high yield debate | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/yield-trumps-spread-great-high-yield-debate-quaglia-2025-01-27/#:~:text=The%20U,level%20is%20near%20the%20average)) ([US credit spreads narrow to new lows as economy looks up | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/us-credit-spreads-narrow-new-lows-economy-looks-up-2024-10-11/#:~:text=Still%2C%20he%20said%20there%20was,sharper%20economic%20slowdown%20than%20anticipated)), underscoring the complacency this strategy seeks to exploit. These and other industry observations support the thesis that significant downside risks are present but not yet fully priced in – the gap our “Big Short” strategy intends to capitalize on.

# High-Upside Short Opportunities: A “Big Short” Style Analysis

## 1. Joann Fabrics & Hooters Bankruptcy Plays  
**Distressed Instruments:** Joann Inc. (the parent of Joann Fabrics) and Hooters of America are both recent examples of highly leveraged companies that ended up in bankruptcy or severe distress. Joann had a publicly traded equity (ticker JOAN) after its 2021 IPO, but that stock was **delisted and essentially wiped out** during its restructuring ([Leonard Green’s Twice-Bankrupt JOANN: A Cautionary Tale?](https://www.privitas.com/leonard-greens-twice-bankrupt-joann-a-cautionary-tale#:~:text=The%20company%20also%20struck%20an,Leonard%20Green%20forfeiting%20its%20stake)). On the debt side, Joann’s capital structure included a $658 million first-lien term loan and other secured loans ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=JOANN%20enters%20Chapter%2011%20with,outstanding%2C%20respectively%2C%20on%20that%20facility)). **Hooters**, while privately owned, **issued about $300 million in asset-backed bonds** via a whole-business securitization in 2021 ([Hooters Restaurant Chain Taps Advisers to Address Debt as Revenue Falls](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/25/hooters-restaurant-chain-taps-advisers-to-address-debt-as-revenue-falls/#:~:text=The%20chain%20has%20about%20%24300,notice%20posted%20to%20KBRA%E2%80%99s%20website)). These bonds are publicly traded debt tied to the Hooters brand and were recently downgraded by Kroll due to deteriorating revenues supporting the debt ([Hooters Restaurant Chain Taps Advisers to Address Debt as Revenue Falls](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/25/hooters-restaurant-chain-taps-advisers-to-address-debt-as-revenue-falls/#:~:text=The%20chain%20has%20about%20%24300,notice%20posted%20to%20KBRA%E2%80%99s%20website)). In short, both companies had investable instruments – Joann’s stock (pre-bankruptcy) and term loans, and Hooters’ franchised-backed notes – that could serve as short targets ahead of or during their financial collapses.

**Secondary Market Plays:** Even if one couldn’t directly short these companies’ equity or bonds before bankruptcy, there were **secondary instruments referencing their debt**. For instance, Joann’s leveraged term loan was widely held by loan investors and likely appeared in **CLO (Collateralized Loan Obligation) portfolios**, meaning CLO tranches were indirectly exposed to Joann ([Leonard Green’s Twice-Bankrupt JOANN: A Cautionary Tale?](https://www.privitas.com/leonard-greens-twice-bankrupt-joann-a-cautionary-tale#:~:text=As%20all%20of%20this%20was,rating%2C%20indicating%20high%20default%20risk)) ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=JOANN%20enters%20Chapter%2011%20with,outstanding%2C%20respectively%2C%20on%20that%20facility)). A savvy trader could **buy credit default swap (CDS) protection** if available on Joann’s loan or **short loan ETFs** holding such names. In Hooters’ case, its whole-business securitization notes might not have single-name CDS, but one could short structured credit funds that held those notes or buy protection on **consumer ABS indices** with similar exposure. Additionally, distressed debt investors could scoop up Hooters’ bonds at a discount and *buy CDS on comparable restaurant chains* as a hedge, effectively shorting Hooters’ credit implicitly. These indirect plays target the **same thesis** – that the companies’ debt will default or drop sharply in value.

**Default Recoveries & Downside:** Historical default data underscores the *high-upside potential of these shorts*. Joann’s first-lien term lenders ultimately received a **mere ~1% recovery** in the bankruptcy plan (virtually a total loss) ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=Under%20the%20plan%2C%20the%20ABL,part%20of%20an%20exit%20package)). In other words, a $100 claim was paid just ~$1 in reorganized equity, indicating how valuable a short position (or CDS protection) would have been if entered at much higher prices. Party City, another PE-backed retailer, saw its notes only recover ~9% ([Retail Bankruptcy Enterprise Values and Creditor Recoveries (2024 ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/retail-bankruptcy-enterprise-values-creditor-recoveries-2024-fitch-case-studies-07-06-2024#:~:text=,recovery)) – similarly dire. These low recovery rates far undercut historical averages and show the potential gain for shorts if one expects a bankruptcy. For benchmarking, *average recoveries* on defaulted first-lien loans and bonds have often been in the 40–70% range historically ([In Crisis Recovery Rates Matter - Alternative Fund Advisors](https://alternativefundadvisors.com/in-times-of-crisis-recovery-rates-matter-a-lot/#:~:text=environment%20in%20which%20default%20rates,recovery%20rate%20becomes%20an%20afterthought)) ([In Crisis Recovery Rates Matter - Alternative Fund Advisors](https://alternativefundadvisors.com/in-times-of-crisis-recovery-rates-matter-a-lot/#:~:text=The%20fact%20that%20recovery%20rates,the%20magnitude%20of%20the%20impact)), but highly leveraged, PE-owned retail names like Joann and Party City have bucked that trend with **single-digit recoveries**. A short seller could have profited from this by shorting the debt at, say, 50¢ on the dollar and covering at 1¢–10¢, or by buying CDS protection that paid out almost the full notional value. **Instruments to target** for such trades included Joann’s now-defunct equity (which plunged from over $10 at IPO to essentially $0), any tradeable loans or bonds (short via brokers or buying puts if available), and CDS on broader retail/consumer credit indices. The **Big Short thesis** here is that heavily indebted companies with deteriorating finances will default, and their securities will collapse in value – as indeed happened with Joann Fabrics and is unfolding with Hooters.

## 2. Broader Private Equity Distress Opportunities  
**Screening for At-Risk Firms:** Private equity (PE) leveraged buyouts often leave companies with **high debt-to-equity ratios and floating-rate debt** – a toxic mix as rates rise. A scan of public markets can identify several **publicly traded companies with significant PE ownership and outsized leverage**. Key metrics include debt/EBITDA (leverage), interest coverage, and looming refinancing needs. For example, **Petco Health & Wellness (WOOF)** – taken public by PE sponsors – saw its interest coverage ratio plunge to **just 0.3× by 2024** as earnings fell and interest costs ballooned ([Interest Coverage Ratio For Petco Health and Wellness Company ...](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:WOOF/explorer/interest_coverage/#:~:text=,0x%2C)). Likewise, **Dun & Bradstreet (DNB)**, re-IPO’d by sponsors in 2020, carries **5.4× net debt/EBITDA with interest coverage below 1×**, signaling strain ([Is Dun & Bradstreet Holdings (NYSE:DNB) A Risky Investment? - Simply Wall St News](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/commercial-services/nyse-dnb/dun-bradstreet-holdings/news/is-dun-bradstreet-holdings-nysednb-a-risky-investment#:~:text=Weak%20interest%20cover%20of%200,want%20to%20see%20what%20the)). When interest coverage approaches or drops below 1.0, it means the company’s operating earnings barely cover (or are insufficient for) interest payments – a red flag for potential default or distress. Another example is **Community Health Systems (CYH)**, a hospital operator loaded with LBO debt; Fitch Ratings labeled it a *“substantial credit risk” with default a real possibility* in 2024 ([CHS kicks off 2024 with a net loss as expenses remain high](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/chs-quarter-one-2024-earnings-net-loss/714339/#:~:text=CHS%20kicks%20off%202024%20with,CHS%20is%20more%20highly)). Screens that filter for **leverage >5× and interest coverage <1.5×** and high floating-rate debt percentages will light up many such names in consumer retail, healthcare services, and other PE-heavy sectors.

**PE-Owned Names and Sector ETFs:** Many PE-backed companies cluster in certain industries – **consumer discretionary and healthcare** in particular. Retailers and restaurants taken private during the 2010s are now reeling under debt (e.g. Michaels Stores, Claire’s, Party City) – some already bankrupt, others still trading. **Consumer discretionary ETFs** (like the SPDR S&P Retail ETF, XRT) and **healthcare ETFs** focusing on services or facilities often hold several of these leveraged names. For instance, an ETF holding hospital companies might include Community Health or Tenet Healthcare (another formerly LBO’d firm), while retail ETFs could have names like **Petco, Sally Beauty, or Bloomin’ Brands**, all of which have notable sponsor ownership and big debt loads. It’s wise to dig into **ETF fact sheets** for the weight of such names. Additionally, **REITs** that were spun out or taken private by PE (or those whose major tenants are PE-owned retailers) warrant caution – for example, certain retail REITs had tenants like Toys “R” Us or Bed Bath & Beyond (both PE-led failures). **Short candidates** can be drawn from these lists: one could short the individual stock or buy puts, or short the sector ETF to get a basket of at-risk firms. The upside on these shorts comes if one or more holdings spiral into distress – the ETF’s value would decline, or the individual stock could plunge or go to zero in a default scenario.

**Refinancing and Maturity Risks:** A critical element is **refinancing risk in a high-rate environment**. Many leveraged loans and junk bonds issued in the late 2010s (or during 2020–21’s easy money period) are coming due in 2024–2026. Companies with **weak credit ratings (B or CCC) face double-digit yields if they attempt to refinance** now, which may be unsustainable. Fitch projects the U.S. institutional loan default rate to rise to around **3.5–4.0% in 2025** (with high-yield bond defaults 2.5–3.0%) as these pressures mount ([2024 US Issuer Default Rate Surpasses Pandemic Levels ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/2024-us-issuer-default-rate-surpasses-pandemic-levels-highlighting-ongoing-risk-31-01-2025#:~:text=,The%20latest%20edition%20of)). A screen for **2025–2026 maturities** relative to free cash flow can highlight firms likely to pursue distressed exchanges or file Chapter 11. For example, if a PE-backed company has a $500M term loan maturing in 2025 and no clear way to repay or refinance (given interest expense already consuming most of its earnings), it’s a prime short candidate. *Comparable historical cases* (e.g., **Joann, Party City, Avaya**) show that when refinancing fails, the equity can be a total wipeout and even senior debt can recover pennies on the dollar ([CASE PROFILE: JOANN Fabric crafts Chapter 11 plan to chop USD 1bn debt load in half, thread the needle for April confirmation - ION Analytics](https://ionanalytics.com/insights/debtwire/case-profile-joann-fabric-crafts-chapter-11-plan-to-chop-usd-1bn-debt-load-in-half-thread-the-needle-for-april-confirmation/#:~:text=Under%20the%20plan%2C%20the%20ABL,part%20of%20an%20exit%20package)) ([Retail Bankruptcy Enterprise Values and Creditor Recoveries (2024 ...](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/retail-bankruptcy-enterprise-values-creditor-recoveries-2024-fitch-case-studies-07-06-2024#:~:text=,recovery)). Thus, shorting stocks or junior bonds ahead of such a credit event can yield very high returns. In practice, an investor might **short the stock of a highly leveraged company** while also **shorting its bonds via a bond ETF** or **buying CDS** – expecting both to drop in value when distress becomes acute.

## 3. Floating-Rate Debt & CLO Market Weakness  
**High-Yield Bond and Loan ETFs:** With so many PE-backed firms issuing **floating-rate leveraged loans**, the **ETF market** offers some broad short opportunities. Funds like the **Invesco Senior Loan ETF (BKLN)** hold dozens of leveraged loans (mostly B rated), offering exposure to floating-rate credit. These loans benefit from rising rates in terms of coupon, but the issuers suffer higher interest costs – increasing default risk. Notably, about *60% of BKLN’s portfolio is rated single-B*, which historically carries significant default risk ([BKLN Senior Loan ETF : r/bonds - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonds/comments/1d9kezr/bkln_senior_loan_etf/#:~:text=BKLN%20Senior%20Loan%20ETF%20%3A,rate%20for%20B%20rated)). **Shorting BKLN or similar loan ETFs** is a way to bet against a broad swath of leveraged loans. The thesis is that as defaults pick up, the NAV of these ETFs will decline (loan prices fall when companies default or distress). Already, market observers note that such loan ETF holdings **“have higher chances of defaults”**, meaning investors could be *“left out to dry”* if they reach for the high yields without recognizing the risk ([Invesco Senior Loan ETF](https://etfdb.com/etf/BKLN/#:~:text=that%20come%20along%20with%20it,and%20want%20a%20diversified%20exposure)). High-yield bond ETFs like HYG or JNK are another avenue – they hold many issuers with floating-rate loans or recent downgrades. **Put options on HYG** can serve as a liquid proxy for shorting the junk bond market’s credit risk. As defaults rise and recovery values fall, high-yield bond prices should drop (spreads widen), which would lift those put options or push ETF prices lower.

**CLOs and Lower-Rated Tranches:** **Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)** – which package loans into tranches – have been a major funding source for PE-backed loans. When looking for a *“Big Short”*-style trade, one might zero in on the **riskier CLO tranches** (BB-rated, B-rated, and equity tranches), which would suffer first in a wave of corporate defaults. CLO equity (the unrated bottom tranche) gets wiped out after a certain level of loan losses, and even BB tranches can be impaired if defaults and losses are **highly correlated across the portfolio**. For instance, historically during the Financial Crisis, some mezzanine tranches of structured products were completely written down. In the case of CLOs, if a recession causes, say, 10–15% of loans to default with only 50% recovery, the **equity tranche and possibly the BBs could be wiped**. In fact, looking back at pre-2008 vintages: in one index of CMBS (a similar structured product), **22 of 25 BBB- tranches in the 2006 series suffered 100% losses** when the underlying loans collapsed ([CMBX 12 Spotlight: If Shorting Office is Your Thing](https://www.trepp.com/trepptalk/cmbx-12-spotlight-if-shorting-office-is-your-thing#:~:text=For%20historical%20reference%2C%20many%20of,losses)). This illustrates the potential severity for structured credit in a worst-case scenario. An investor expecting a cascade of defaults could **target CLO equity or BB tranches** by shorting vehicles that hold them. For example, publicly traded funds like **Eagle Point Credit (ECC)** or **Oxford Lane (OXLC)** primarily invest in CLO equity. Shorting their stock is an indirect way to bet against the lowest tranche of the loan market. Similarly, one could attempt to buy CDS protection on a broad loan index (like **LCDX**, if available, which tracks syndicated loan credit risk). While the CLO structure historically has built-in cushions (diversification and excess spread), a systemic default wave would cause correlations to spike – meaning even well-structured CLOs could see the junior debt suffer **outsized losses relative to initial expectations**.

**Derivative Overlays:** For advanced traders, there are **derivative instruments that reference CLO tranches**. Some investment banks make markets in **index tranches** or bespoke swaps on CLO mezzanine tranches. For instance, an investor could buy protection on a **“CLO BB tranche index”** if one exists, or simply short a **high-yield CLO fund**. The idea is to express a view that **defaults will cluster** among heavily indebted loan issuers (many of them PE-backed), causing disproportionate damage to the lower tranches of CLOs. Another approach is a **long/short between tranches**: short the equity tranche while going long the AAA tranche (or short BB vs long AA) to isolate credit deterioration risk. In summary, by using ETFs, closed-end funds, or synthetic indices, one can bet on **floating-rate loan weakness**. These strategies all capitalize on the theme that **floating rates have pushed interest burdens to breaking points** for weak borrowers, and when those borrowers default, the contagion will be felt in the loan funds and CLO securities that hold their debt.

## 4. Interest Rate Sensitivity & Default Risks  
**Shorting Credit via CDS Index:** A straightforward way to bet on rising defaults (and widening credit spreads) is through **CDS indices** like the **CDX series**. The **CDX High Yield index** aggregates CDS on 100 non-investment-grade companies. By **buying protection on the CDX HY**, an investor is effectively short the high-yield market – if defaults rise or spreads blow out, the protection pays off as the index value falls. These indices are very liquid and track broad credit risk. For example, in a stress scenario where default rates jump, one would expect the **CDX HY spread to widen significantly** (e.g., from ~400 basis points to 800+), generating mark-to-market gains for protection buyers. Another relevant index is the **CDX North American Investment Grade**, but that includes higher-quality credits; a more targeted play on distress is **CDX HY or CDX Crossover (in Europe)**. There are even tranches of CDX one can trade (equity, mezzanine tranches of the index) that mimic different default scenarios – *shorting the equity tranche of CDX HY* (i.e. buying equity tranche protection) is akin to betting on a severe default wave among the weakest credits in the index. These indices provide a cleaner hedge or speculative short than shorting individual names, with the benefit of diversification (one default won’t make or break the payout – you get the average outcome). During the 2008 big short, traders used ABX (for subprime mortgages); here the analog is **CDX for corporate credit**.

**Put Options and Synthetic Shorts:** If CDS is not accessible, **put options on high-yield bond ETFs** (or short futures on credit indices, if available) can mimic a short credit position. Buying **deep out-of-the-money puts on HYG or JNK** is a way to pay a small premium upfront for a potentially large payoff if credit markets tank. For instance, a put option on HYG with a strike well below current levels would soar in value if junk bond prices fell dramatically (which they would if defaults surge and recoveries disappoint). Such a strategy is analogous to Michael Burry’s shorts via CDS in “The Big Short,” but using stock options that are easily traded. Another approach is **shorting high-yield mutual funds or total return swap indices** that track leveraged loans or bonds. Some ETF providers even offer instruments like **“HY credit hedge” ETFs** that combine a long position in bonds with a short overlay ([Credit Hedging Done Right: CDX Outperforms with Defense | Simplify](https://www.simplify.us/etfs-use-case/credit-hedging-done-right-cdx-outperforms-defense#:~:text=Simplify%20www,it%20when%20credit%20spreads%20widen)) – one could short those to get a net short. Additionally, **interest rate futures** can be part of the strategy: since rising rates contribute to distress, one might short credit *and* hedge by *going long Treasuries* (expecting a flight to quality). In 2022–2023, as rates climbed, we saw credit spreads initially remain moderate, but the real pain could come if the economy turns and defaults materialize on top of high rates. **Buying interest rate caps or swaptions** could also be a play for those expecting continued rate volatility affecting floating-rate debt.

**Hedging and Risk Management:** Importantly, any short credit position should consider **interest rate risk**. High-yield bonds and loans have two components: credit spread and base interest rate. If one is short an index like HYG, and the Fed suddenly cuts rates, the loss from falling Treasury yields could offset some gains from widening spreads. To isolate **credit risk premia**, an investor can **short corporate bonds while going long equivalent-duration Treasuries**. This hedge removes most of the interest rate sensitivity (making the position respond primarily to default risk and spread changes). For example, an investor might short a basket of BBB/BB bonds and simultaneously go long an equal-duration position in U.S. Treasury bonds. This way, if yields fall (which often happens in a recession as a policy response), the Treasury longs gain, offsetting the effect on the short corporate bonds, while the corporates underperform due to credit fears. Another strategy: use **CDS indices which inherently strip out interest rate moves**, since they pay off based on defaults/spreads. Furthermore, one can roll positions to maintain optimal exposure – e.g. **roll CDS index series** or rotate option strikes as conditions change. Risk management is crucial; these shorts can have negative carry (CDS and puts cost money to carry). Thus, sizing the position and timing are important – using **out-of-the-money options limits downside**, and using index products provides diversification to avoid idiosyncratic risk (e.g., a single company unexpectedly getting bailed out or bought at a high price). In summary, a combination of **CDS indices, ETF puts, and careful hedging with rates instruments** allows one to express a bearish view on corporate defaults while mitigating extraneous risks.

## 5. Commercial Real Estate & Systemic Risks  
**Shorting CMBS (CMBX) Indices:** The commercial real estate (CRE) sector – particularly offices and retail properties – is widely seen as the next frontier for a “big short.” Instruments known as **CMBX** (indexes of CMBS credit default swaps) allow traders to **short tranches of commercial mortgage-backed securities**. Each CMBX series corresponds to a vintage of CMBS deals; for example, **CMBX Series 6 (2012)** has a lot of shopping mall exposure and was famously shorted by some hedge funds as “the next big short” against malls ([CMBX 12 Spotlight: If Shorting Office is Your Thing](https://www.trepp.com/trepptalk/cmbx-12-spotlight-if-shorting-office-is-your-thing#:~:text=reference%20tranches%20suffered%20100)). More recently, **CMBX Series 12 (issued around 2018)** has drawn attention for its heavy **office loan exposure (~31.6% of its reference pool)** ([CMBX 12 Spotlight: If Shorting Office is Your Thing](https://www.trepp.com/trepptalk/cmbx-12-spotlight-if-shorting-office-is-your-thing#:~:text=shorts%20include%20Vornado%20and%20SL,Green)). An investor worried about a wave of office mortgage defaults (due to remote work and vacancies) can **buy protection on CMBX 12 BBB- or BB tranches**, effectively betting those securities will incur losses. The cost of protection (spread) on these indices has already risen – for instance, **CMBX 12 BBB- spiked from ~300 bps to ~750 bps during early COVID** turmoil ([CMBX 12 Spotlight: If Shorting Office is Your Thing](https://www.trepp.com/trepptalk/cmbx-12-spotlight-if-shorting-office-is-your-thing#:~:text=The%20index%20has%2031.6,for%20CMBX%207)) – reflecting increasing fear of defaults. If office defaults accelerate, those spreads could widen further, and the protection buyer profits. The trade is parallel to shorting subprime CDOs in 2008: here one shorts lower-rated CMBS tranches that could become worthless if enough loans default. **Mall-related CMBS** shorts have started to pay off as well: many legacy mall loans liquidated at huge losses, validating the CMBX 6 shorts. Now the focus is on **downtown office towers** with plunging valuations. A well-timed CMBX short can yield large gains if, say, a 50% default rate on office loans in the index causes *most of the BBB-/BB tranches to be written down to zero*. History shows this is possible – many lower-rated tranches in mid-2000s CMBS deals were completely wiped out ([CMBX 12 Spotlight: If Shorting Office is Your Thing](https://www.trepp.com/trepptalk/cmbx-12-spotlight-if-shorting-office-is-your-thing#:~:text=For%20historical%20reference%2C%20many%20of,losses)).

**REITs and Equity Shorts:** Another angle is shorting the **public REITs** most exposed to distressed property types. Two notable examples are **office REITs** like *Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)* and *SL Green (SLG)*, which concentrate in NYC office buildings. Hedge funds like Jonathan Litt’s Land & Buildings have disclosed short positions on such REITs, expecting their property values and rents to drop ([CMBX 12 Spotlight: If Shorting Office is Your Thing](https://www.trepp.com/trepptalk/cmbx-12-spotlight-if-shorting-office-is-your-thing#:~:text=Well%2C%20the%20Wall%20Street%20Journal,include%20Vornado%20and%20SL%20Green)). Similarly, **retail-focused REITs** owning malls or power centers can be short targets (though many have already been beaten down). The idea is that public equity markets may not fully reflect how far asset values have fallen. If an office building’s value drops 40-50%, highly leveraged owners could be insolvent – and even REITs with moderate leverage might trade below book value. Shorting REIT stocks or **buying puts on an ETF like XLRE/IYR** (which have office/retail components) is a liquid way to express this. Keep in mind, some REITs have strong balance sheets, so one must **pick the weak players** – e.g., those with high debt ratios and large chunks of leases rolling over soon. **Retail REITs with secondary-market malls** were a big short in 2017–2020; now **office REITs** are in the crosshairs. The upside on a REIT short is potentially significant: in extreme cases, the equity could go to zero (if the firm defaults), or more commonly, a heavily shorted REIT might cut its dividend and see its stock fall 50%+ as earnings evaporate. This occurred with some mall REITs that went bankrupt or had to restructure loans.

 ([The U.S. Banks With the Most Commercial Real Estate Exposure](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/which-big-u-s-banks-have-the-most-commercial-real-estate-exposure/)) *Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loan exposure of the largest U.S. banks (Q3 2023). Each pie shows a top 20 bank’s total loan book with the orange slice representing CRE loans. Note that some regional banks like New York Community Bank (NYCB) had ~37% of their loans in CRE, far more concentrated than big banks – a red flag that led Moody’s to downgrade NYCB’s credit rating to junk status. Sources: UBS data via Q3’23 ([The U.S. Banks With the Most Commercial Real Estate Exposure](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/which-big-u-s-banks-have-the-most-commercial-real-estate-exposure/#:~:text=The%20six%20largest%20U,rates%20and%20increasing%20borrowing%20costs)) and Apollo analysis (['There Will Be More Failures,' Powell Says In Warning For Regional Banks Over Commercial Real Estate Loans - Truist Finl (NYSE:TFC), SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (ARCA:KRE) - Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/03/37565353/there-will-be-more-failures-powell-says-in-warning-for-regional-banks-over-commercial-real-estat#:~:text=Recent%20data%20from%20Apollo%20Academy,of%20their%20total%20assets)).*

**Banking Sector Risks:** A systemic concern is that **regional and small banks are heavily exposed to CRE**.

In fact, smaller banks hold about **70% of all commercial real estate loans** in the U.S. by some estimates (['There Will Be More Failures,' Powell Says In Warning For Regional Banks Over Commercial Real Estate Loans - Truist Finl (NYSE:TFC), SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (ARCA:KRE) - Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/03/37565353/there-will-be-more-failures-powell-says-in-warning-for-regional-banks-over-commercial-real-estat#:~:text=Recent%20data%20from%20Apollo%20Academy,of%20their%20total%20assets)). As office and retail property values fall, **banks could face rising delinquencies and losses**. We’re already seeing this: at large banks, office loan delinquencies surged to **11% (highest since 2014)** according to the Fed’s late-2024 supervision report ([Big Banks Face 11% Default Rate in Commercial Real Estate Test - The Global Treasurer](https://www.theglobaltreasurer.com/2024/11/15/big-banks-face-11-default-rate-in-commercial-real-estate-test/#:~:text=The%20U,Federal%20Reserve%E2%80%99s%20latest%20supervision%20report)). Industry-wide, MBA data showed office mortgage delinquencies jumping to **6.5% by Q4 2023** ([

This suggests some banks will incur significant write-downs. **Short opportunities** here include shorting the **regional bank ETF (KRE)** or specific bank stocks with outsized CRE portfolios. For example, stocks like **Truist (TFC)**, **U.S. Bancorp (USB)**, and **NYCB** have been identified as having tens of billions in CRE loans (['There Will Be More Failures,' Powell Says In Warning For Regional Banks Over Commercial Real Estate Loans - Truist Finl (NYSE:TFC), SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (ARCA:KRE) - Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/03/37565353/there-will-be-more-failures-powell-says-in-warning-for-regional-banks-over-commercial-real-estat#:~:text=Among%20them%2C%20Truist%20Financial%20Corp,cutting%20back%20on%20CRE%20lending)) (['There Will Be More Failures,' Powell Says In Warning For Regional Banks Over Commercial Real Estate Loans - Truist Finl (NYSE:TFC), SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (ARCA:KRE) - Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/03/37565353/there-will-be-more-failures-powell-says-in-warning-for-regional-banks-over-commercial-real-estat#:~:text=loans)). Notably, New York Community Bancorp’s share price fell over 70% at one point in 2023 as it acknowledged larger-than-expected CRE loan losses (['There Will Be More Failures,' Powell Says In Warning For Regional Banks Over Commercial Real Estate Loans - Truist Finl (NYSE:TFC), SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (ARCA:KRE) - Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/03/37565353/there-will-be-more-failures-powell-says-in-warning-for-regional-banks-over-commercial-real-estat#:~:text=New%20York%20Community%20Bancorp%20has,to%20have%20%2451%20billion%20outstanding)). An investor could short such banks, anticipating further declines if office loans default en masse. Another angle is **shorting bank loan portfolios** via ETFs that track bank loans or shorting indexes of **mortgage REITs** that hold commercial mortgages. Also, **buying CDS on banks** with high CRE exposure is a possibility – if available – to bet on widening credit spreads for those financials. The risk to watch is that banks may be cushioned by reserves or regulatory forbearance in the near term, so timing is key. But as Powell warned, *“there will be more bank failures”* linked to CRE stress if conditions worsen (['There Will Be More Failures,' Powell Says In Warning For Regional Banks Over Commercial Real Estate Loans - Truist Finl (NYSE:TFC), SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (ARCA:KRE) - Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/03/37565353/there-will-be-more-failures-powell-says-in-warning-for-regional-banks-over-commercial-real-estat#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThere%20will%20be%20more%20bank,the%20commercial%20real%20estate%20sector)). 

**Systemic Hedge Considerations:** A CRE-driven credit event could have broader market implications, so one might combine direct shorts with hedges. For instance, if short regional bank stocks, one might hedge with a long position in large money-center banks (which have more diversified portfolios and less CRE concentration). Or if shorting CMBS/CMBX, perhaps hedge with a **long position in Agency MBS** (which are housing-related and government-backed, thus likely to hold value better). The *systemic “big short” theme* ties together private equity LBO debt and commercial real estate: both are domains where low rates masked high leverage, and now higher rates are exposing the frailties. By carefully selecting instruments – whether corporate CDS indices, CLO tranches, CMBS indices, or equity of exposed firms – an investor can build a **short portfolio positioned to profit from a rise in default rates and credit stress**. Crucially, such a portfolio should be monitored and hedged for extraneous moves (like central bank interventions or surprise refinancing deals) to manage risk. But if the thesis plays out, the upside can be significant, much like the original Big Short – **turning a series of well-researched, targeted shorts into outsized gains when the credit cycle turns**.
