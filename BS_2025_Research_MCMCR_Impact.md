# Impact of the 2025 Continuing Resolution on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Healthcare Companies

## Funding Changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security

**Medicare:** The 2025 full-year continuing resolution (CR) does **not slash Medicare benefits**, but it does extend an existing **2% across-the-board cut** in Medicare provider payments (the sequestration) for an additional two months ([What's in the House's Full-Year Continuing Resolution?-2025-03-11](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-houses-full-year-continuing-resolution#:~:text=The%20bill%20also%20contains%20about,by%20an%20additional%20two%20months)). In other words, Medicare spending is effectively **reduced by 2%** during that period (roughly a 0.5% cut on an annualized basis). Additionally, Congress **allowed a scheduled 2.8% cut in Medicare physician reimbursements** to take effect in 2025 ([Spending proposal means devastating 5th year of Medicare pay cuts | American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/medicare-medicaid/spending-proposal-means-devastating-5th-year-medicare-pay#:~:text=In%20his%20statement%20issued%20Sunday%2C,%E2%80%9D)), failing to include a fix in the CR. This 2.8% reduction in payments to doctors is not a direct cut to the Medicare program’s total budget, but it lowers provider payment rates and has raised concerns about access to care in rural and underserved areas ([Spending proposal means devastating 5th year of Medicare pay cuts | American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/medicare-medicaid/spending-proposal-means-devastating-5th-year-medicare-pay#:~:text=In%20his%20statement%20issued%20Sunday%2C,%E2%80%9D)). Aside from these provider payment trims, **Medicare’s overall funding level remains essentially flat** – the CR funded government programs at roughly FY2024 levels ([What's in the House's Full-Year Continuing Resolution?-2025-03-11](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-houses-full-year-continuing-resolution#:~:text=The%20full,two%20CRs%20and%20this%20one)), so there was **no broad percentage cut to Medicare benefits** or enrollment. (Notably, a potential 4% Medicare PAYGO cut was averted by separate legislative action ([Key Healthcare Provisions in Congress’ Continuing Resolution | Forvis Mazars](https://www.forvismazars.us/forsights/2025/01/key-healthcare-provisions-in-congress-continuing-resolution#:~:text=,health%20emergency%20and%202024%20hurricanes)), so Medicare beneficiaries were shielded from any benefit reduction.)

**Medicaid:** The CR imposes **no net cut to Medicaid funding (0% reduction)**. In fact, it **postponed previously scheduled cuts**. Under prior law, Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments were slated to be reduced by **$8 billion (per year) starting FY 2025** – about a 32% cut to safety-net hospital DSH allotments in states like Texas ([](https://www.tha.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-DSH-Cuts-by-Congressional-District_05.pdf#:~:text=address%20the%20Medicaid%20DSH%20cuts,for%20distributing%20federal%20DSH%20allotment)). The CR **eliminated those Medicaid DSH cuts through FY 2025**, preventing that funding loss ([House passes continuing resolution to fund government through ...](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2025-03-11-house-passes-continuing-resolution-fund-government-through-september-extend-key-health-care-provisions#:~:text=,Medicare%20Rural)) ([Key Healthcare Provisions in Congress’ Continuing Resolution | Forvis Mazars](https://www.forvismazars.us/forsights/2025/01/key-healthcare-provisions-in-congress-continuing-resolution#:~:text=,the%20program%20through%20March%2031)). In effect, Medicaid’s federal spending is maintained at current levels (or higher, relative to what it would have been with the cuts). The CR continues federal support for Medicaid expansion and other programs without reductions. There were **no across-the-board benefit cuts** to Medicaid enrollees, consistent with political promises that Medicaid benefits would not be reduced ([Republicans split on spending cuts, Medicaid as they seek path forward on Trump tax cuts | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-split-spending-cuts-medicaid-they-seek-path-forward-trump-tax-cuts-2025-03-16/#:~:text=Trump%20has%20promised%20that%20those,will%20not%20see%20reduced%20benefits)). (It’s worth noting Medicaid is a huge program – ~$618 billion federal cost last year ([Republicans split on spending cuts, Medicaid as they seek path forward on Trump tax cuts | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-split-spending-cuts-medicaid-they-seek-path-forward-trump-tax-cuts-2025-03-16/#:~:text=The%20program%2C%20funded%20jointly%20by,the%20Social%20Security%20retirement%20program)) – and the debate has been around slowing growth, but this CR did **not** implement new caps or block grants.) In summary, **Medicaid funding saw a 0% cut** – indeed a scheduled cut was reversed, effectively **preserving full funding** for FY2025.

**Social Security:** The continuing resolution made **no cuts to Social Security benefits (0% reduction)**. Social Security checks to retirees and disabled individuals continue in full, with cost-of-living adjustments unaffected. Lawmakers in both parties have steered clear of reducing Social Security benefits, and President Trump himself vowed not to cut Social Security or Medicare benefits ([Republicans split on spending cuts, Medicaid as they seek path forward on Trump tax cuts | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-split-spending-cuts-medicaid-they-seek-path-forward-trump-tax-cuts-2025-03-16/#:~:text=Trump%20has%20promised%20that%20those,will%20not%20see%20reduced%20benefits)). The CR keeps Social Security trust fund spending on autopilot, as usual. One area impacted is the **Social Security Administration’s (SSA) operating budget** – the CR funds federal agencies at prior-year levels, which effectively leaves SSA with a tight budget. Freezing the SSA budget at FY2024 levels (despite higher workloads and inflation) could strain customer service. The House Appropriations Committee’s analysis warned that the full-year CR might force SSA to reduce staff, causing office closures and backlogs for beneficiaries ([Republican Full-Year Continuing Resolution | House Committee on Appropriations](http://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/news/fact-sheets/republican-full-year-continuing-resolution#:~:text=,for%20Social%20Security%20beneficiaries%20trying)). However, those are administrative challenges; **Social Security benefit payments themselves are not reduced** by any percentage. In short, **Social Security benefits see no funding cut** in the CR, maintaining a **0% reduction**, while SSA’s administrative funding is flat (a modest cut in real terms, leading to service impacts).

## Publicly Traded Companies Affected by the CR

The healthcare industry’s reaction centers on companies that rely heavily on **federal healthcare reimbursements**. Changes (or potential changes) in Medicare/Medicaid funding directly impact these firms’ revenues. Key categories include:

- **Hospital Operators:** Large for-profit hospital chains derive a significant share of patient revenue from Medicare and Medicaid. Examples include **Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH)**, **HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA)**, **Tenet Healthcare (NYSE: THC)**, and **Universal Health Services (NYSE: UHS)**. Medicare and Medicaid combined account for roughly 50% (or more) of revenue for these operators ([CHS revenue broken down by payer - Becker's Hospital Review | Healthcare News & Analysis](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/chs-revenue-broken-down-by-payer.html#:~:text=Commercial%3A%20%241)) ([HCA's Q1 payer mix | Becker's](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/news-and-analysis/hcas-q1-payer-mix.html#:~:text=Commercial%3A%2049.2)). For instance, Community Health Systems’ payer mix is ~37% Medicare (including Medicare Advantage) and 14% Medicaid – over half of its revenue comes from government programs ([CHS revenue broken down by payer - Becker's Hospital Review | Healthcare News & Analysis](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/chs-revenue-broken-down-by-payer.html#:~:text=Commercial%3A%20%241)). These hospital companies are directly affected by any change in Medicare inpatient rates, Medicaid DSH payments, etc. The CR’s extension of a 2% Medicare cut and its decisions on Medicaid funding (like DSH) feed into their top-line revenue projections.

- **Health Insurers & Managed Care Organizations:** Insurers that administer Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Part D drug plans, and state Medicaid managed care are highly exposed to federal payment rates. The biggest players are **UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH)**, **Humana (NYSE: HUM)**, **Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC)**, and **CVS Health (NYSE: CVS)** (which owns Aetna). These firms collectively cover tens of millions of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. For example, **Humana** is predominantly a Medicare Advantage insurer – individual and group MA plans constitute 38% of Humana’s membership but about **86% of its premium revenue** ([Humana expects to lose 'few hundred thousand' Medicare ...](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/humana-membership-losses-medicare-advantage-plan-cuts/722619/#:~:text=Humana%20expects%20to%20lose%20%27few,That%20gamble%20started)). **Centene** is the largest Medicaid managed care organization, with ~21 million Medicaid members; Medicaid and related programs make up the majority of its ~$163 billion annual revenue ([Republicans split on spending cuts, Medicaid as they seek path forward on Trump tax cuts | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-split-spending-cuts-medicaid-they-seek-path-forward-trump-tax-cuts-2025-03-16/#:~:text=Hanging%20in%20the%20balance%20is,analysis%20of%20Medicaid%20data%20shows)) ([Centene Corporation - Fact Sheet - Q4 - 2024](https://www.centene.com/content/dam/centenedotcom/investor_docs/CNC-FactSheet-2024-Q4.pdf#:~:text=under,on%20Centene%E2%80%99s%20investor%20relations%20website)). **UnitedHealth** and **CVS/Aetna** also have substantial Medicare Advantage enrollment and Medicaid contracts, alongside commercial insurance. Any policy that slows Medicare Advantage payment growth or caps Medicaid spending directly hits enrollment growth and premiums for these insurers. In this CR, since benefits were maintained, these insurers avoided major immediate disruptions; however, the ongoing 2% Medicare sequester does apply to Medicare Advantage payments as well (reducing what the government pays plans). 

- **Other Healthcare Providers and Suppliers:** Numerous other publicly traded healthcare companies depend on federal reimbursements:
  - **Skilled Nursing and Senior Care:** Nursing home operators like *The Ensign Group* (NASDAQ: ENSG) rely on Medicaid (which pays for long-term care) and Medicare (short-term rehab stays). Ensign, for example, receives roughly **60% of its skilled nursing revenue from Medicaid** and another ~30% from Medicare, meaning ~90% government payer mix ([

Any Medicaid rate cuts or changes to Medicare post-acute payments could significantly affect their earnings. The CR’s avoidance of Medicaid cuts is critical for these operators’ stability.
  - **Healthcare Services and Providers:** Companies ranging from dialysis providers (e.g., *DaVita* (NYSE: DVA), which gets ~90% of dialysis patient revenue from Medicare) to home health agencies (e.g., *Amedisys*, now part of UnitedHealth’s Optum) and hospice providers are all tethered to federal payment policies. These firms watched the CR closely. Dialysis companies, for instance, faced the 2% Medicare sequester extension (a 2% revenue hit on treatments covered by Medicare).
  - **Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Firms:** While drug and device makers are paid by private and public insurers, Medicare and Medicaid represent a large customer base. Major pharma companies (e.g., Pfizer, Merck) earn a substantial portion of revenue from Medicare Part D and B spending. They are indirectly affected by budget constraints on those programs. (The CR did not enact drug pricing cuts beyond what’s already in law, but any signals of Medicare cost-cutting can influence these companies’ outlooks.)
  - **Others:** Providers of behavioral health services (many patients covered by Medicaid), clinical labs (Medicare is a big payer for lab tests), and healthcare facilities (rural hospitals, rehab centers) all fall under the umbrella of those impacted. For example, UHS’s behavioral health division treats many Medicaid patients; Medicaid funding stability – as ensured in this CR – is crucial for that segment.

In summary, **any publicly traded company with a large portion of revenue tied to Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements is affected** by the spending provisions of the CR. Hospitals and managed care companies felt the impact most directly. Companies with more diversified or commercial revenue (e.g., a device maker like Medtronic, or an insurer with a large employer insurance book) are less immediately affected by a Medicare/Medicaid funding freeze, but still monitor these developments.

## Financial Impact on Affected Companies

The continuing resolution’s modest cuts and maintained funding have **tangible financial effects** on these companies’ debt, revenues, and market performance. Below we break down the key impact areas:

- **Revenue and Profitability:**  With Medicare and Medicaid rates essentially flat or slightly trimmed, providers and payers face **lower revenue growth** than expected. For hospitals, the 2% Medicare sequester means they receive 98 cents on the dollar for Medicare services, which **directly reduces revenue by 2% for those payments**. For a company like HCA, with ~33–35% of its revenue coming from Medicare ([HCA's Q1 payer mix | Becker's](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/news-and-analysis/hcas-q1-payer-mix.html#:~:text=Commercial%3A%2049.2)), a 2% cut on that portion translates to roughly a **0.7% hit to total revenue**. Medicaid funding was kept stable, which is a relief, but no increase means hospitals can’t offset rising costs with higher Medicaid rates – effectively a margin squeeze since inflation (staff wages, supplies) is running higher than 0%. The **Medicare physician fee cut (2.8%)** doesn’t hit hospitals directly unless they employ physicians, but it does impact primary care and specialty clinics (and could push more physicians to become hospital employees for financial stability ([Spending proposal means devastating 5th year of Medicare pay cuts | American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/medicare-medicaid/spending-proposal-means-devastating-5th-year-medicare-pay#:~:text=%E2%80%9CLet%20me%20be%20clear%3A%20These,has%20seen%20the%20effects%20firsthand))). Managed care insurers like Humana and Centene see a similar effect: the 2% sequester applies to Medicare Advantage plan payments, trimming the premiums received from CMS. They will try to adjust by reducing costs or slightly increasing beneficiary cost-sharing (within regulatory limits) to maintain margins. Overall, profit margins in sectors with heavy government exposure may tighten by a few tenths of a percent due to these reimbursement changes. The **American Medical Association warned** that allowing the physician pay cut to proceed without an inflation update threatens practice viability ([Spending proposal means devastating 5th year of Medicare pay cuts | American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/medicare-medicaid/spending-proposal-means-devastating-5th-year-medicare-pay#:~:text=In%20his%20statement%20issued%20Sunday%2C,%E2%80%9D)) – smaller providers may see profitability turn negative, though large firms can absorb the hit more easily. On the flip side, by averting the massive Medicaid DSH cut, the CR **avoided a potentially severe revenue shock** for safety-net hospitals. Had the $8B cut (a ~12% reduction in federal Medicaid DSH outlays ([[PDF] Medicaid DSH Cuts Will Harm Patient Care](https://www.tha.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-DSH-Cuts-by-Congressional-District_05.pdf#:~:text=,CHIP%20Payment%20Access%20Commission))) gone into effect, companies like CYH or Tenet (which operate some safety-net hospitals) would have lost millions in annual payments. Thus, the CR’s maintenance of funding preserves revenue that these companies would have otherwise lost. Net-net, the **CR keeps revenue relatively stable** – with a small haircut on Medicare rates – but in a high-cost environment even flat nominal revenue puts pressure on earnings. Companies will likely cite “government reimbursement headwinds” in their earnings guidance, but the impact is on the order of low-single-digit percentage changes to earnings rather than a drastic cut.

- **Debt Service and Refinancing Risks:** For **highly leveraged companies**, even a slight drop in cash flow can raise credit risk. This is most evident for **Community Health Systems (CYH)**. CYH carries roughly **$12 billion of long-term debt** and has a thin margin, so reduced Medicare payments or stagnant Medicaid funding make it harder to cover interest costs. Rating agencies have flagged CYH’s heavy debt burden (its debt-to-EBITDA exceeds 6–7×) and upcoming maturities in 2026–2027 as a major concern ([Fitch Downgrades Community Health Systems IDR to 'CCC+'](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-downgrades-community-health-systems-idr-to-ccc-08-12-2023#:~:text=Fitch%20Downgrades%20Community%20Health%20Systems,a%20lower%20interest%20rate%20environment)) ([Community Health Systems ($CYH): Identifying Value Across $12 ...](https://www.junkbondinvestor.com/p/community-health-systems-cyh-identifying#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%20,grapples%20with%20high%20debt%20levels)). Fitch Ratings downgraded CYH to CCC+ in 2023, citing the need to refinance debt in a higher interest rate environment ([Fitch Downgrades Community Health Systems IDR to 'CCC+'](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-downgrades-community-health-systems-idr-to-ccc-08-12-2023#:~:text=Fitch%20Downgrades%20Community%20Health%20Systems,a%20lower%20interest%20rate%20environment)). The CR’s policies won’t single-handedly push CYH into default, but the **continuation of the Medicare sequester means ~$4 billion less Medicare spending over 10 years** across the sector ([What's in the House's Full-Year Continuing Resolution?-2025-03-11](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-houses-full-year-continuing-resolution#:~:text=Policy%20Ten,Net%20Fiscal%20Impact%20%247%20billion)) – a portion of that is lost revenue for CYH that could have helped de-leverage. **Every 1% of revenue loss** can be critical for a company with sub-2% profit margins. CYH will likely need to refinance bonds at interest rates that are 2–3 percentage points higher than its existing coupons, increasing annual interest expense. If Medicare cuts had been deeper (or if Medicaid DSH cuts had hit), CYH’s **cash flow could have dropped below what’s needed for interest payments**, greatly heightening default risk. While that worst-case was avoided, CYH remains vulnerable: its CFO noted that **97% of its debt is at fixed rates through 2025** ([Community Health Systems, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter and ...](https://chsnet.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/community-health-systems-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-year-7#:~:text=Community%20Health%20Systems%2C%20Inc,percentage%20of%20net%20operating)), but when those rates reset, any revenue shortfall could coincide with higher interest costs. Other hospital chains like Tenet (debt ~$15B) also have significant leverage (~4× EBITDA) but stronger current cash flows; they face refinancing of some loans in coming years. **Rising interest rates and flat reimbursement = less coverage cushion.** In contrast, companies like HCA and UHS have more moderate leverage and solid interest coverage, so they are better positioned to weather flat Medicare rates. Nonetheless, across the healthcare provider sector, credit analysts have observed record-high defaults in 2023–2024, especially among highly leveraged providers ([Record-High Health Care Defaults Will Moderate In 2025, Though Higher Than Normal | S&P Global Ratings](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/241120-record-high-health-care-defaults-will-moderate-in-2025-though-higher-than-normal-13332545#:~:text=North%20American%20for,revenue%20growth%20and%20EBITDA%20margins)) ([Record-High Health Care Defaults Will Moderate In 2025, Though Higher Than Normal | S&P Global Ratings](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/241120-record-high-health-care-defaults-will-moderate-in-2025-though-higher-than-normal-13332545#:~:text=%2A%20Defaults%20among%20for,in%202025%2C%20given%20continued%20interest)). Keeping federal payments stable in the CR likely prevents an immediate spike in defaults. But for the **weakest borrowers (e.g. CYH)**, the combination of high debt and any future policy uncertainty (like the next potential sequester or budget negotiation) remains a significant refinancing risk.

- **Stock Price Volatility and Investor Sentiment:** Healthcare stocks reacted to the budget news with **modest volatility**. Investors had been on alert for potential spending cuts, so the largely status-quo outcome in the CR was greeted with a mix of relief and ongoing caution. In the trading sessions around the CR’s passage (mid-March 2025), major hospital stocks and insurers moved only slightly. For example, **Humana’s stock (HUM)** dipped ~0.4% the day after the House passed the CR (reflecting initial worry that the Medicare Advantage rates might be constrained), but then **rebounded over 1% in the following days** ([Historical Price Lookup | Humana Inc. - Investor Relations](https://humana.gcs-web.com/stock-information/historical-price-lookup#:~:text=Historical%20Price%20Lookup%20,88)) as it became clear that Medicare funding levels were essentially unchanged and the risk of a government shutdown was gone. Hospital operators’ shares similarly **stabilized** – HCA and Tenet saw minor swings of 1–2% in that week. **Community Health Systems (CYH)**, being a small-cap company, experienced a bit more volatility; its stock fell several percent when the physician pay cut news hit (since rural hospitals and doctors could be affected), but it recovered when Medicaid DSH cuts were rescinded (a significant positive for CYH’s rural safety-net hospitals). Overall, the sector avoided any drastic sell-off. Equity analysts noted that the CR “**averts worst-case scenarios** for healthcare earnings,” and as a result, many healthcare stocks maintained their prior trading ranges. That said, sentiment remains **guarded**: investors recognize that while this CR didn’t significantly cut entitlements, future budget fights could resurface the issue. We saw credit default swap spreads (a measure of perceived risk) for some hospital operators **narrow** slightly after the CR passed – indicating reduced immediate default risk. In summary, the market reaction was one of **short-term relief**, reflected in stable or slightly rising stock prices after the announcement. Any remaining stock price pressure on these companies is more due to broader issues (labor costs, utilization trends) than this CR. The takeaway for investors was that Congress is not (for now) cutting Medicare or Medicaid benefits – a fundamentally positive signal for the stability of revenue streams. However, companies heavily dependent on government payments continue to trade at valuation discounts, pricing in the longer-term political risk.

- **Future Policy Expectations:** Although not an immediate financial impact, it’s worth noting that this CR sets the stage for future budget negotiations. Healthcare executives are reading the tea leaves: the House budget blueprint seeks **$2 trillion in spending cuts** over the decade ([House passes budget resolution potentially impacting Medicaid | AHA News](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2025-02-26-house-passes-budget-resolution-potentially-impacting-medicaid#:~:text=The%20House%20of%20Representatives%20last,debt%20ceiling%20by%20%244%20trillion)) ([Republicans split on spending cuts, Medicaid as they seek path forward on Trump tax cuts | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-split-spending-cuts-medicaid-they-seek-path-forward-trump-tax-cuts-2025-03-16/#:~:text=A%20main%20question%20for%20Republican,House%20of%20Representatives%20last%20month)), and some lawmakers have pointed to Medicaid as a target. The fact that the CR preserved funding this time provides short-term certainty. But companies like Centene and CVS (with big Medicaid businesses) are already scenario-planning for 2026 and beyond – e.g. what if a per-capita cap or block grant replaces today’s funding? Those would materially reduce long-run revenue. Thus, while **immediate-term financials are intact, strategic planning and investor dialogue are very focused on policy risk**. We can expect slightly higher risk premiums (e.g., debt yields) for firms like CYH, and stock multiples for government-focused insurers may stay somewhat compressed, reflecting that overreliance on federal programs ties their fortunes to political decisions.

## Financial Risk Assessment of the Most Vulnerable Companies

Not all companies are affected equally – some are far more at risk from any tightening of federal healthcare spending. We identify below the companies most vulnerable to the CR’s funding levels (and by extension, those that would be most impacted if future cuts occur), along with a risk assessment:

- **Community Health Systems (CYH):** *Vulnerability: Very High.* CYH stands out as one of the **riskiest** publicly traded healthcare companies in this context. It has a **high debt load** (over $11.5 billion in long-term debt ([10-Q - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108109/000095017024117088/cyh-20240930.htm#:~:text=10,225%20billion)), over 7× EBITDA) and over half its patient revenue comes from Medicare/Medicaid ([CHS revenue broken down by payer - Becker's Hospital Review | Healthcare News & Analysis](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/chs-revenue-broken-down-by-payer.html#:~:text=Commercial%3A%20%241)). Its hospitals serve many rural and poorer communities – any cut to Medicare hospital rates or Medicaid payments hits CYH’s thin margins hard. The CR’s 2% Medicare cut extension and flat Medicaid funding will cost CYH a few million dollars in 2025 that it can scarcely afford to lose. With annual interest expense near $800 million, CYH’s interest coverage is precarious. **Refinancing risk is acute:** the company must address major debt maturities by 2026-2027 ([Fitch Downgrades Community Health Systems IDR to 'CCC+'](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-downgrades-community-health-systems-idr-to-ccc-08-12-2023#:~:text=Fitch%20Downgrades%20Community%20Health%20Systems,a%20lower%20interest%20rate%20environment)), and if interest rates remain high, rolling over that debt could increase annual interest costs by tens of millions. A **downturn in operating income (even modest)** due to reimbursement cuts would increase the likelihood of default or restructuring. Credit ratings in the CCC range reflect this risk. In our assessment, CYH can manage through 2025 with current cash flow (especially since the Medicaid DSH cut was averted, which would have cost CYH an estimated $70+ million annually). But its **financial flexibility is minimal** – it is highly vulnerable to any further Medicare sequester extensions or new cuts. We assign CYH the highest risk level: it faces **solvency risk** if conditions worsen. Investors will demand a high yield from CYH to compensate for this risk, and the stock will remain volatile. (On the upside, the CR’s avoidance of big cuts gives CYH a fighting chance to improve performance in 2025 through volume growth and cost control.)

- **Tenet Healthcare (THC) and Other Leveraged Hospital Chains:** *Vulnerability: Moderate.* Tenet and similarly positioned hospital companies (e.g., LifePoint Health, which is privately held, and some regional systems) have substantial debt but better profitability than CYH. Tenet has been diversifying into ambulatory surgery centers (via its United Surgical Partners division) which rely more on private insurance. Still, about 45–50% of Tenet’s hospital revenue comes from Medicare and Medicaid. We view Tenet’s risk as **moderate** – it can weather a 2% Medicare trim, but if cumulative cuts reached, say, 5–10%, Tenet’s EBITDA would be significantly impacted given its leverage (~4× debt/EBITDA). The CR’s maintenance of Medicaid DSH funding also helps Tenet’s few safety-net hospitals. **Debt refinancing**: Tenet pushed out many maturities by refinancing at lower rates in 2021; its next large maturity is a 2026 bond. If government funding were cut deeply, rating agencies could downgrade the debt, raising refinancing costs. For now, Tenet retains stable access to capital (rated in the single-B range). We flag **other hospital operators** (including some not publicly traded) as a sector: if future budgets cut healthcare, this entire group’s credit risk would rise. In 2024, a record 14 healthcare companies defaulted (many were small hospital systems) ([Record-High Health Care Defaults Will Moderate In 2025, Though Higher Than Normal | S&P Global Ratings](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/241120-record-high-health-care-defaults-will-moderate-in-2025-though-higher-than-normal-13332545#:~:text=North%20American%20for,revenue%20growth%20and%20EBITDA%20margins)) ([Record-High Health Care Defaults Will Moderate In 2025, Though Higher Than Normal | S&P Global Ratings](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/241120-record-high-health-care-defaults-will-moderate-in-2025-though-higher-than-normal-13332545#:~:text=%2A%20Defaults%20among%20for,in%202025%2C%20given%20continued%20interest)), underscoring that this sector is one where small margin hits can cause outsized distress.

- **Health Insurers Focused on Government Programs:** *Vulnerability: Moderate to High (company-specific).* Among insurers, **Centene Corporation (CNC)** is particularly exposed. Centene’s business is roughly 70% Medicaid, 15% Medicare, 15% ACA Marketplace ([CENTENE CORPORATION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2024 ...](https://investors.centene.com/2024-10-25-CENTENE-CORPORATION-REPORTS-THIRD-QUARTER-2024-RESULTS#:~:text=CENTENE%20CORPORATION%20REPORTS%20THIRD%20QUARTER,Total%20premium%20and)). It is profitable and not overly leveraged, so short-term financial risk is moderate. However, **strategic risk is high**: if federal Medicaid spending growth slows (for example, if enrollment declines or per-member funding is capped), Centene’s revenues could stagnate or fall. The end of the pandemic continuous enrollment already caused Medicaid membership to drop in 2024, and Centene’s revenue fell slightly in that segment ([Obamacare Leads Centene To $3.3 Billion 2024 Profit As Medicaid ...](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2025/02/04/obamacare-leads-centene-to-33-billion-2024-profit-as-medicaid-drops/#:~:text=Obamacare%20Leads%20Centene%20To%20%243,a%20dip%20in%20Medicaid%20enrollment)). The CR didn’t exacerbate that – in fact, it preserved funding – but it also did not restore the pandemic-era membership levels. Centene must navigate state Medicaid rebidding and potential policy changes; any substantial cut in federal support could force states to lower payments to managed care plans. We consider Centene’s **financial risk manageable** (low debt, strong liquidity), but its **business risk tied to policy** is significant. **Humana (HUM)**, on the other hand, while extremely exposed to Medicare Advantage, has a strong capital position and consistent profitability. Humana’s main risk from the CR was the potential for lower MA rate growth – since that didn’t happen (no new cap on MA rates was introduced, and the sequester was already known), Humana’s immediate financial risk is low. However, **if Medicare spending becomes a target** in future budget talks, Humana could see plan payments constrained. Investors recognize this risk – Humana’s stock tends to swing on news of Medicare Advantage benchmark changes. We categorize **Humana’s vulnerability as moderate**: very dependent on one federal program, but currently financially solid. **Molina Healthcare (NYSE: MOH)** (a smaller Medicaid insurer) is similar to Centene in risk profile for Medicaid exposure. **CVS Health (CVS)** has Aetna and a big Medicare Part D business, but because CVS also has a diversified health services business (pharmacy retail, PBM), its overall risk from entitlement funding changes is lower. In short, insurers have the **ability to adjust** (they can sometimes trim medical costs or admin expenses if premiums from the government come in lower), so their risk is more about long-term growth prospects than immediate solvency. The most vulnerable in this group would be any insurer heavily government-focused *and* thinly capitalized – right now, most big players are well-capitalized, so the risk of bankruptcy is low; the risk is more on their **future earnings trajectory** if cuts happen.

- **Skilled Nursing Facilities & Post-Acute Providers:** *Vulnerability: High.* Nursing home operators and home health agencies operate on razor-thin margins and rely predominantly on government payers. **The Ensign Group (ENSG)**, for example, is financially healthy (profitable, growing, with reasonable debt), but about 90% of its revenue comes from Medicare or Medicaid programs. If Medicaid rates were frozen or cut, many nursing facilities would quickly feel the pain. Medicaid is notorious for low reimbursement that often doesn’t cover costs; facilities depend on small annual rate increases to keep up with wages. The CR’s outcome (no Medicaid cuts, plus extensions of certain enhanced payments like spousal impoverishment protections and money-follows-the-person programs) was **critical to this sector**. **Risk assessment:** Ensign and peers can handle the status quo, but are highly vulnerable to policy changes. If federal Medicaid funds to states were trimmed, states might cut nursing home rates – a direct hit to earnings. **Genesis Healthcare**, a large nursing home chain (now private), previously went through restructuring largely due to Medicaid underpayments. That serves as a cautionary tale: sustained funding pressures could push weaker operators into bankruptcy. We rate the sector’s risk as **high**, mitigated in Ensign’s case by good management and diversification across many states (some states would likely boost their share if federal share dropped, buffering impact). Home health and hospice companies also get a majority of revenue from Medicare (home health agencies get ~70-80% from Medicare). They faced a separate Medicare payment rebasing cut in 2024–2025, which is squeezing margins. The CR did extend certain temporary Medicare add-on payments for rural home health ([House passes continuing resolution to fund government through September, extend key health care provisions | AHA News](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2025-03-11-house-passes-continuing-resolution-fund-government-through-september-extend-key-health-care-provisions#:~:text=,30%2C%202025)), which was positive. Nonetheless, smaller home health firms are at risk of closure if Medicare cuts aren’t addressed. Publicly traded home health companies (now mostly folded into larger entities like Optum) have more cushion, but the sector overall remains fragile.

- **Big Pharma and Medical Device Companies:** *Vulnerability: Low (to CR funding changes).* While these companies are affected by Medicare policies (e.g., drug price negotiations in the Inflation Reduction Act), the CR’s spending levels don’t directly cut into pharma or device revenues in the near term. We consider companies like **Pfizer, Merck, J&J, Medtronic** to have low direct risk from this CR. Medicare Part A/B spending on drugs and devices will continue as normal. The risk would rise if Medicare decided to aggressively cut provider payments for therapies or if Medicaid budgets forced states to restrict drug coverage – neither of which occurred in this CR. Thus, we can say this category is **not immediately vulnerable** to the CR, though they have other regulatory risks on the horizon.

In conclusion, the 2025 Continuing Resolution brought **stability in the short term** for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security funding – avoiding drastic cuts that could have triggered immediate financial crises for healthcare companies. The **exact funding reductions were minor (2% to Medicare provider payments, none to Medicaid or Social Security)**, so most publicly traded healthcare firms dodged a bullet. However, the analysis above highlights that **certain companies remain financially vulnerable** due to heavy dependence on federal reimbursements and high debt. Investors and stakeholders will need to keep a close watch on Washington: future budget negotiations or healthcare reforms that alter Medicare/Medicaid funding growth could quickly change the outlook for these firms. For now, the CR’s passage has been met with **cautious optimism**, and healthcare executives can breathe a small sigh of relief that the government funding for key programs will continue at prior levels – at least through the end of this fiscal year ([Congress passes Full-Year Continuing Resolution Bill, maintaining global health funding at prior year levels | KFF](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/congress-passes-full-year-continuing-resolution-bill-maintaining-global-health-funding-at-prior-year-levels/#:~:text=On%20March%2015%2C%202025%2C%20the,Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and)).
