The chain was loaded with debt by its private equity owner and ultimately filed bankruptcy in 2024.* ([Joann store closures among many Leonard Green and Partners bankruptcies - Private Equity Stakeholder Project PESP](https://pestakeholder.org/news/joann-store-closures-among-many-leonard-green-and-partners-bankruptcies/#:~:text=Leonard%20Green%20and%20Partners%20first,9)) ([Fabrics and crafts retailer Joann filed for bankruptcy ](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2024/03/18/fabrics-and-crafts-retailer-joann-filed-for-bankruptcy/#:~:text=The%20retail%20chain%20cut%20its,interest%20costs%20in%20recent%20years))  

Joann Inc. (the parent of Jo-Ann Fabrics and Crafts stores) provides a cautionary tale of how heavy debt and rising interest costs can devastate a retailer. The company was taken private in 2010 via a $1.6 billion leveraged buyout by Leonard Green & Partners, a private equity firm ([Joann store closures among many Leonard Green and Partners bankruptcies - Private Equity Stakeholder Project PESP](https://pestakeholder.org/news/joann-store-closures-among-many-leonard-green-and-partners-bankruptcies/#:~:text=Leonard%20Green%20and%20Partners%20first,9)). Under PE ownership, Joann was **saddled with over $1 billion of debt** by the time it hit financial trouble ([Joann store closures among many Leonard Green and Partners bankruptcies - Private Equity Stakeholder Project PESP](https://pestakeholder.org/news/joann-store-closures-among-many-leonard-green-and-partners-bankruptcies/#:~:text=Leonard%20Green%20and%20Partners%20first,9)). Sales initially surged during the pandemic lockdowns (as homebound consumers took up crafting), but that boost quickly faded as shopping habits normalized ([Fabrics and crafts retailer Joann filed for bankruptcy ](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2024/03/18/fabrics-and-crafts-retailer-joann-filed-for-bankruptcy/#:~:text=Like%20many%20of%20its%20retail,home%20activities%20like%20crafting)). Joann’s revenues began a multi-year decline amid competition and changing consumer behavior, even as inflation and supply-chain snags raised its costs ([Fabrics and crafts retailer Joann filed for bankruptcy ](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2024/03/18/fabrics-and-crafts-retailer-joann-filed-for-bankruptcy/#:~:text=Advertisement)). This weak operating performance left Joann poorly positioned to carry its enormous debt load. 

Compounding the problem, **much of Joann’s debt carried floating interest rates**, which meant its interest expense climbed sharply as the Federal Reserve raised rates ([Fabrics and crafts retailer Joann filed for bankruptcy ](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2024/03/18/fabrics-and-crafts-retailer-joann-filed-for-bankruptcy/#:~:text=The%20retail%20chain%20cut%20its,interest%20costs%20in%20recent%20years)). In a higher-rate environment, Joann’s interest payments consumed a growing share of cash flow and strained its liquidity. (For example, similar retailers that borrowed via floating-rate loans around 2020–21 saw interest rates jump from ~3–4% to around 9%, dramatically increasing their debt service burden ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=Investors%20fear%20unsustainably%20high%20interest,the%20company%E2%80%99s%20August%20earnings%20call)).) Joann could not generate enough earnings to support its debt, and by March 2024 the company **filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy** to restructure roughly $1.1 billion of obligations ([Joann store closures among many Leonard Green and Partners bankruptcies - Private Equity Stakeholder Project PESP](https://pestakeholder.org/news/joann-store-closures-among-many-leonard-green-and-partners-bankruptcies/#:~:text=Leonard%20Green%20and%20Partners%20first,9)). The pre-packaged bankruptcy plan aimed to cut about half a billion in debt and came with $132 million in new financing to keep operations running ([Fabrics and crafts retailer Joann filed for bankruptcy ](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2024/03/18/fabrics-and-crafts-retailer-joann-filed-for-bankruptcy/#:~:text=Delaware%20early%20Monday,1%20billion%20to%20%2410%20billion)) ([Fabrics and crafts retailer Joann filed for bankruptcy ](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2024/03/18/fabrics-and-crafts-retailer-joann-filed-for-bankruptcy/#:~:text=Joann%E2%80%99s%20lenders%20struck%20a%20restructuring,certain%20loans%20and%20credit%20facilities)). Notably, the **entire equity stake of Leonard Green was wiped out**, and ownership transferred to lenders in the restructuring ([Fabrics and crafts retailer Joann filed for bankruptcy ](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2024/03/18/fabrics-and-crafts-retailer-joann-filed-for-bankruptcy/#:~:text=Fabric%20and%20crafts%20retailer%20Joann,boom%20during%20pandemic%20lockdowns%20faded)). Joann briefly emerged from bankruptcy in mid-2024, but its relief was short-lived. With interest rates still high and sales still weak, the company **filed for bankruptcy again in January 2025**, a rare “Chapter 22” scenario ([Leonard Green's Twice-Bankrupt JOANN: A Cautionary Tale?](https://www.privitas.com/leonard-greens-twice-bankrupt-joann-a-cautionary-tale#:~:text=2025%20got%20off%20to%20a,under%2012%20months%20this%20January)). This time, Joann announced it would liquidate: all 800 stores are slated to close and 19,000 employees will lose their jobs ([Which JOANN Stores Are Closing?

In sum, a once-profitable 80-year-old retailer was brought down by excessive leverage and higher interest costs. Joann’s public shareholders also suffered a complete loss – after the company’s 2021 IPO at $12 per share, the stock **lost roughly 98% of its value** before being delisted in bankruptcy ([JOAN Stock Alert: Joann Finally Files for Ch. 11 Bankruptcy](https://www.webull.com/news/10424269194298368#:~:text=Joann%20suffered%20a%20horrible%20two,of%20its%20value%20since)). Joann’s collapse has raised pointed questions about the role of private equity in retail failures ([Why is Joann fabrics closing?

## Hooters: Debt Challenges and Imminent Bankruptcy

Hooters of America, the restaurant chain famous for its chicken wings and casual atmosphere, is another example of financial strain in a high-interest-rate era. Hooters was acquired in 2019 by private equity investors (Nord Bay Capital and TriArtisan Capital), who, in 2021, financed the business with **about $300 million in securitized debt** ([Hooters Restaurant Chain Taps Advisers to Address Debt as Revenue Falls](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/25/hooters-restaurant-chain-taps-advisers-to-address-debt-as-revenue-falls/#:~:text=Hooters%2C%20which%20was%20acquired%20by,news%20outlets%20at%20the%20time)) ([Hooters Restaurant Chain Taps Advisers to Address Debt as Revenue Falls](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/25/hooters-restaurant-chain-taps-advisers-to-address-debt-as-revenue-falls/#:~:text=The%20chain%20has%20about%20%24300,notice%20posted%20to%20KBRA%E2%80%99s%20website)). This financing was a “whole-business securitization” – effectively, Hooters issued bonds backed by its franchise royalties and other assets ([Hooters Restaurant Chain Taps Advisers to Address Debt as Revenue Falls](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/25/hooters-restaurant-chain-taps-advisers-to-address-debt-as-revenue-falls/#:~:text=The%20chain%20has%20about%20%24300,notice%20posted%20to%20KBRA%E2%80%99s%20website)). The deal provided Hooters with cash (and likely helped pay dividends or prior debts), but it left the company on the hook to bondholders. Unfortunately, the timing proved poor. In recent years, Hooters has faced **declining foot traffic and sales**, part of a broader slump in casual dining. The company has shuttered dozens of underperforming restaurants, citing “pressure from current market conditions” ([Hooters Restaurant Chain Taps Advisers to Address Debt as Revenue Falls](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/25/hooters-restaurant-chain-taps-advisers-to-address-debt-as-revenue-falls/#:~:text=Hooters%2C%20which%20was%20acquired%20by,news%20outlets%20at%20the%20time)). By late 2024, Hooters’ revenues had fallen enough that **its debt coverage deteriorated**, prompting Kroll Bond Rating Agency to downgrade the Hooters asset-backed notes ([Hooters Restaurant Chain Taps Advisers to Address Debt as Revenue Falls](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/25/hooters-restaurant-chain-taps-advisers-to-address-debt-as-revenue-falls/#:~:text=The%20chain%20has%20about%20%24300,notice%20posted%20to%20KBRA%E2%80%99s%20website)). With liquidity dwindling, Hooters began working with turnaround advisers (Accordion Partners and law firm Ropes & Gray) and its lenders on a plan to restructure the business through bankruptcy court ([Hooters Restaurant Chain Taps Advisers to Address Debt as Revenue Falls](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/25/hooters-restaurant-chain-taps-advisers-to-address-debt-as-revenue-falls/#:~:text=%28Bloomberg%29%20,with%20knowledge%20of%20the%20talks)). 

As of early 2025, Hooters is reportedly preparing to **file for Chapter 11 protection** in the coming months ([For anyone who wants to unpack why PE firms screw up companies ...](https://x.com/christinelu/status/1892988339441033300#:~:text=For%20anyone%20who%20wants%20to,file%20for%20bankruptcy%20to)) ([Hooters Bankruptcy Plan Could Shift Brand Control Back to Former ...](https://www.themiddlemarket.com/latest-news/hooters-bankruptcy-plan-could-shift-brand-control-back-to-former-parent#:~:text=Hooters%20Bankruptcy%20Plan%20Could%20Shift,Hooters%20issued%20%24300%20million)). The goal would be to renegotiate the $300 million debt and possibly transfer ownership (one proposal could even shift the Hooters brand back to previous owners) ([Hooters Bankruptcy Plan Could Shift Brand Control Back to Former ...](https://www.themiddlemarket.com/latest-news/hooters-bankruptcy-plan-could-shift-brand-control-back-to-former-parent#:~:text=Hooters%20Bankruptcy%20Plan%20Could%20Shift,Hooters%20issued%20%24300%20million)). Hooters’ situation highlights how **private-equity-backed companies can run into trouble when growth plans falter but debt remains due**. In Hooters’ case, the debt is in the form of bonds (likely with fixed coupon payments), so rising benchmark rates might not have increased its interest payments immediately. However, the **high-rate environment still hurt Hooters indirectly**: it made refinancing or raising new capital more expensive and it squeezed consumers’ dining-out budgets, contributing to Hooters’ sales decline. With earnings under pressure, even a fixed debt burden can become unmanageable. Hooters’ looming insolvency will also test the “safety” of its securitized bonds – these bonds were sold to investors as relatively secure (thanks to franchising fees as collateral), but a bankruptcy will reveal how much protection that structure truly provides ([Hooters Bankruptcy Threatens Even Bonds Supposed to Be ...](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hooters-bankruptcy-threat-imperils-even-175239679.html#:~:text=Hooters%20Bankruptcy%20Threatens%20Even%20Bonds,are%20packaged%20as%20whole)) ([Hooters' Problems Pose a Test for Securitizations - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hooters-problems-pose-test-securitizations-200000138.html#:~:text=Hooters%27%20Problems%20Pose%20a%20Test,would%2C%20largely%20because%20of)). Overall, like Joann, Hooters illustrates the vulnerability of highly leveraged companies, especially those involved with private equity, when business performance weakens in a higher-interest-rate climate. 

## Floating-Rate Loans and Rising Default Risk 

Joann and Hooters are part of a larger trend of debt-distressed companies in this “higher for longer” interest rate environment. In particular, firms that borrowed heavily via **floating-rate loans** (such as leveraged loans tied to LIBOR/SOFR) during the low-rate years are now seeing their **interest costs skyrocket**. For example, Petco – a pet supply retailer that, like Joann, was taken private by PE and later re-listed – took out a $1.7 billion term loan in early 2021 at around 3.5% interest. That rate has since jumped to nearly 9%, and Petco’s annual interest expense surged to almost **25% of its free cash flow** by 2023 (up from under 5% two years prior) ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=Investors%20fear%20unsustainably%20high%20interest,the%20company%E2%80%99s%20August%20earnings%20call)). This is a dramatic shift that squeezes profit margins. Petco’s management has acknowledged relieving this interest burden as a top priority, and the company has focused on debt reduction initiatives ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=to%20nearly%20a%20quarter%20of,the%20company%E2%80%99s%20August%20earnings%20call)). Many other indebted companies face a similar squeeze. During the 2020–2021 period, **dozens of corporations took on “leveraged loans” at ultra-low rates**, often to fund private-equity buyouts or expansion plans ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=Petco%20isn%E2%80%99t%20alone,stay%20high%20for%20some%20time)). These loans typically carry floating rates, so as the Fed hiked short-term rates, the loan payments increased in tandem ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=Petco%20isn%E2%80%99t%20alone,stay%20high%20for%20some%20time)). 

The result is a growing wave of corporate distress. According to Fitch Ratings, nearly **$270 billion of U.S. leveraged loans** are now on their “weak credit” watch list and potentially at risk of default ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=Nearly%20%24270%20billion%20of%20leveraged,has%20helped%20issuers%20withstand%20rising)). The trailing 12-month default rate on leveraged loans (around 5% as of late 2024) is the highest in nearly a decade (excluding the brief spike in 2020) ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=Nearly%20%24270%20billion%20of%20leveraged,has%20helped%20issuers%20withstand%20rising)). Notably, U.S. **consumer discretionary companies led all sectors in bankruptcy filings in 2023**, which saw the most corporate bankruptcies since 2010 ([Fabrics and crafts retailer Joann filed for bankruptcy ](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2024/03/18/fabrics-and-crafts-retailer-joann-filed-for-bankruptcy/#:~:text=In%20an%20environment%20of%20relatively,2010%2C%20according%20to%20S%26P%20Global)). Rising interest expenses have been a key factor pushing many of these firms over the edge. Joann explicitly cited increased interest rates on its floating-rate debt as a contributor to its bankruptcy ([Mario Nawfal - X](https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1901766747994132918#:~:text=WALL%20STREET%20IS%20COLLAPSING%20COMPANIES,Why)). Likewise, Party City and Bed Bath & Beyond – both of which filed bankruptcy in the past year – had capital structures that became untenable once debt servicing costs rose and sales softened. In essence, the **low-interest era masked the fragility** of highly leveraged companies; now the tide has gone out, revealing who cannot swim. Covenant-lite loan terms (very loose debt covenants common in recent years) have so far delayed some defaults, but they may also lead to lower recoveries when defaults do occur ([Vulnerabilities associated with leveraged loans and collateralised loan obligations](https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P191219.pdf#:~:text=are%20satisfied,There%20is%20some%20evidence%20that)) ([Vulnerabilities associated with leveraged loans and collateralised loan obligations](https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P191219.pdf#:~:text=had%20lower%20recovery%20rates%20than,sell%20assets%2C%20pay%20dividends%2C%20or)). Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen warned back in 2018 that she was *“worried about the systemic risks”* associated with these leveraged loans, noting a *“huge deterioration in standards”* such as weakened covenants ([Looming Risk to Financial System: $1 Trillion in Commercial Loan Pools - UCLA Anderson Review](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/looming-risk-to-financial-system-1-trillion-in-commercial-loan-pools/#:~:text=market%2C%20its%20structure%20and%20mechanics,in%202018)). Those concerns are being validated as interest rates stay elevated. Companies that piled on adjustable-rate debt now face a lethal combination of higher interest expense and tighter lending conditions, forcing many into restructuring or liquidation. 

## Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) and Pension Fund Exposure 

The leveraged loans underpinning this corporate debt stress are often packaged into **Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)** – financial instruments reminiscent of the mortgage CDOs of 2008, but composed of corporate loans. CLOs are structured portfolios of dozens of loans made to junk-rated or highly indebted companies (the Joanns and Petcos of the world, for example). The loans are sliced into tranches of varying seniority and risk, from AAA-rated down to equity. The CLO market has grown **very large (over $1 trillion globally)**, reflecting the boom in corporate debt over the past decade ([Looming Risk to Financial System: $1 Trillion in Commercial Loan Pools - UCLA Anderson Review](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/looming-risk-to-financial-system-1-trillion-in-commercial-loan-pools/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20CLOs%2C%20housing,credit%20ratings%20%E2%80%94%20in%202021)). As of 2021, roughly $800 billion in U.S. loans and $200 billion in European loans were housed in CLOs ([Looming Risk to Financial System: $1 Trillion in Commercial Loan Pools - UCLA Anderson Review](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/looming-risk-to-financial-system-1-trillion-in-commercial-loan-pools/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20CLOs%2C%20housing,credit%20ratings%20%E2%80%94%20in%202021)), and CLOs purchased about 75% of all new leveraged loan issuance that year ([Looming Risk to Financial System: $1 Trillion in Commercial Loan Pools - UCLA Anderson Review](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/looming-risk-to-financial-system-1-trillion-in-commercial-loan-pools/#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20of%20CLOs%2C%20housing,credit%20ratings%20%E2%80%94%20in%202021)). These structures aim to spread out risk – the higher-rated tranches have priority on cash flows and are meant to withstand a certain level of loan defaults. However, if default rates rise high enough, the lower tranches can be wiped out and even senior tranches can be impacted. 

**Pension funds have some exposure to CLOs**, though they are not the largest holders. U.S. pensions hold roughly 6–11% of outstanding CLO securities by most estimates ([Who Owns CLOs? Fed Research Sheds Some Light](https://www.garp.org/risk-intelligence/credit/who-owns-clos-fed-research-sheds-some-light#:~:text=The%20institutional,or%20other%20investment%20vehicles%209)) ([Who Owns CLOs?

In dollar terms, U.S. pension funds were estimated to hold on the order of **$22–57 billion** of CLO notes (data from late 2018 to 2019) ([The Fed - Who Owns U.S. CLO Securities? An Update by Tranche](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/who-owns-us-clo-securities-an-update-by-tranche-20200625.html#:~:text=Mutual%20Fund%2061%2C537%2018.1,0)) ([Vulnerabilities associated with leveraged loans and collateralised loan obligations](https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P191219.pdf#:~:text=companies,including%20broker%20dealers%20and%20holding)). Critically, pensions (and insurance companies) tend to invest predominantly in the **AAA-rated CLO tranches**, seeking the extra yield these offer over comparably rated corporate or government bonds ([The Fed - Who Owns U.S. CLO Securities? An Update by Tranche](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/who-owns-us-clo-securities-an-update-by-tranche-20200625.html#:~:text=Insurance%20Company%2053%2C687%2049.3,5%2C251%2020.0)) ([The Fed - Who Owns U.S. CLO Securities?

Fitch Ratings noted that pension funds were generally buyers of only the safest CLO notes ([The Fed - Who Owns U.S. CLO Securities? An Update by Tranche](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/who-owns-us-clo-securities-an-update-by-tranche-20200625.html#:~:text=To%20summarize%2C%20our%20new%20data,rated%20notes)). The Fed’s analysis confirms that about 77% of CLO holdings by pension funds are the senior (mostly AAA) notes ([The Fed - Who Owns U.S. CLO Securities? An Update by Tranche](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/who-owns-us-clo-securities-an-update-by-tranche-20200625.html#:~:text=Insurance%20Company%2053%2C687%2049.3,5%2C251%2020.0)). This means that under most foreseeable scenarios of loan defaults, pension funds would be shielded from losses until the very worst-case scenarios (since equity and mezzanine tranches would absorb losses first). That said, it’s not entirely risk-free – **pension funds and other investors have shown some appetite for riskier CLO tranches in recent years**, likely in a hunt for yield ([Vulnerabilities associated with leveraged loans and collateralised loan obligations](https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P191219.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L2002%20Anecdotal%20evidence,riskier%20mezzanine%20and%20equity%20tranches)). The Fed found that nearly a quarter of the CLO securities held by U.S. pensions were mezzanine or junior equity tranches. If pensions (or their asset managers) dip further into lower-rated tranches, they could face hits if corporate defaults surge. 

The big question is whether CLO exposure poses a **systemic risk** to the economy, especially via pension funds. Most experts do *not* see CLOs as the same kind of threat that subprime CDOs posed in 2008, largely because the highest-risk pieces are held by specialized investors (hedge funds, CLO managers, etc.) rather than systemically critical institutions. Banks hold mainly the AAA CLO tranches, and even there the exposures are modest relative to bank capital ([Who Owns CLOs? Fed Research Sheds Some Light](https://www.garp.org/risk-intelligence/credit/who-owns-clos-fed-research-sheds-some-light#:~:text=The%20institutional,or%20other%20investment%20vehicles%209)) ([Who Owns CLOs? Fed Research Sheds Some Light](https://www.garp.org/risk-intelligence/credit/who-owns-clos-fed-research-sheds-some-light#:~:text=holdings%20of%20Cayman%20Islands,and%20funds%20or%20other)). Pension funds’ CLO holdings are also a small fraction of their overall asset bases (U.S. pension assets total many trillions of dollars, making a few dozen billion in CLOs relatively minor). Moreover, CLOs historically have performed well through market cycles – even in the 2008–09 crisis, **default rates on CLO tranches were very low for senior notes**, and diversifying across many loans provides some cushion ([[PDF] Leveraged Loans and CLOs Good Practices for Consideration](https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD766.pdf#:~:text=,well%20during%20the%20Global)). That said, regulators remain watchful. The **Financial Stability Board (FSB)** and others have noted that a severe stress in the leveraged loan market could transmit to insurers, pensions, and asset managers holding CLOs ([[PDF] Vulnerabilities associated with leveraged loans and collateralised ...](https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P191219.pdf#:~:text=,46)) ([Vulnerabilities associated with leveraged loans and collateralised loan obligations](https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P191219.pdf#:~:text=for%20insurers%2C%20pension%20funds%20and,implications%20of%20the%20exposures%20of)). If a recession caused an unexpectedly large wave of corporate defaults, lower-tier CLO tranches would suffer and even some higher tranches could be downgraded or lose value. **Pension funds could incur losses or funding shortfalls** in such a scenario, and at the extreme, forced selling by pensions or insurers (due to rating downgrades or liquidity needs) could amplify market stress ([CLOs: A market on edge - Private Debt Investor](https://www.privatedebtinvestor.com/clos-a-market-on-edge/#:~:text=CLOs%3A%20A%20market%20on%20edge,debt%20to%20cover%20margin%20calls)) ([Vulnerabilities associated with leveraged loans and collateralised loan obligations](https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P191219.pdf#:~:text=for%20insurers%2C%20pension%20funds%20and,implications%20of%20the%20exposures%20of)). In sum, pension funds *do* have exposure to CLOs – primarily to the safest tranches – and this is one avenue by which the corporate debt bubble could affect the broader financial system. While it doesn’t appear to be an imminent systemic crisis on the order of the mortgage meltdown, the interconnections (the “financial plumbing”) mean that **widespread corporate defaults would still send shockwaves** through credit markets and hit many investors, including pensioners, to some degree. The “iron triangle” of **private equity, leveraged loans, and pensions** is one that analysts caution could harbor latent systemic risks if the current debt cycle ends poorly ([CLOs, Private Equity, Pensions, and Systemic Risk](https://www.pm-research.com/content/iijstrfin/26/1/8#:~:text=Systemic%20risk%3A%20The%20Iron%20Triangle,GFC)). 

## Short-Selling Opportunities Amid Debt Distress 

Given the analysis above, there may be strategic opportunities for investors to **short sell** certain stocks or financial instruments that are most at risk from these debt problems. The core idea is to identify companies or sectors that look overvalued or unstable due to **heavy leverage, rising interest expense, and deteriorating fundamentals**, and bet that their equity or debt prices will fall. Below are a few potential short plays, supported by the financial trends we’ve discussed:

- **Heavily Indebted Consumer Companies:** Publicly traded companies that went through leveraged buyouts or debt-fueled expansions are prime candidates. For example, **Petco Health and Wellness (NASDAQ: WOOF)** stands out. Petco was taken private multiple times by PE firms and still carries a *“mountain of debt”* (net debt about 6.5× EBITDA post-2015 buyout) ([Petco’s IPO: All Bark and No Bite? - Private Equity Stakeholder Project PESP](https://pestakeholder.org/news/petcos-ipo-all-bark-and-no-bite-2/#:~:text=,operating%20lease%20liabilities%20are%20included)). As noted, its interest costs have surged to ~9% on a $1.7 billion loan, crushing profits ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=Investors%20fear%20unsustainably%20high%20interest,the%20company%E2%80%99s%20August%20earnings%20call)). Petco’s sales growth has been stagnant (under 2% annually in recent years) ([Petco’s IPO: All Bark and No Bite? - Private Equity Stakeholder Project PESP](https://pestakeholder.org/news/petcos-ipo-all-bark-and-no-bite-2/#:~:text=,pet%20care%20industry%20more%20broadly)) and it faces tough competition from Chewy and Amazon. This combination of **high debt, rising interest expense, and weak growth** makes Petco’s stock a potential short target. Indeed, investors are increasingly fearful that unsustainably high rates will lead such leveraged companies to default ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=Investors%20fear%20unsustainably%20high%20interest,of%20cash%20flow)). If Petco cannot substantially improve earnings or refinance its debt, equity holders could be wiped out – a scenario shorts would profit from. Another category is **legacy retailers or restaurant chains that are still public and carry LBO debt**, similar to Joann or Hooters. Many have already gone bankrupt (Party City, Bed Bath & Beyond, Rite Aid, etc.), but a few remain. Investors could screen for companies with high debt-to-EBITDA ratios, significant floating-rate debt, and recent losses. If any such company’s stock price doesn’t yet reflect the bankruptcy risk, it could be a candidate to short. History shows these stories can end badly for equity – Joann’s stock, for instance, collapsed from a $12 IPO to mere cents (–98%) in three years ([JOAN Stock Alert: Joann Finally Files for Ch. 11 Bankruptcy](https://www.webull.com/news/10424269194298368#:~:text=Joann%20suffered%20a%20horrible%20two,of%20its%20value%20since)), and **short sellers of JOAN would have netted substantial gains**. 

- **High-Yield Bonds and Leveraged Loan ETFs:** Rather than shorting individual companies, one can short the **asset classes** that encompass these risky debts. For instance, an investor bearish on leveraged credit could short an ETF like the Invesco Senior Loan ETF (ticker: `BKLN`), which holds a broad portfolio of leveraged loans (the same kind that populate CLOs). If corporate defaults increase, the market value of these loans should fall, pushing down the ETF’s price. Similarly, one could short high-yield bond ETFs such as `HYG` or `JNK`, expecting credit spreads to widen and junk bond prices to drop as financially weak firms falter. This strategy is effectively a bet against the **junk debt market** as a whole. With Fitch projecting more defaults and noting multi-year high distress levels ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=Nearly%20%24270%20billion%20of%20leveraged,has%20helped%20issuers%20withstand%20rising)), a short position on these ETFs could pay off if the trend materializes. (One could also buy credit default swap protection on high-yield indexes as an alternative, though that’s a more complex trade.) The viability of this play hinges on the economy and interest rates – if the Fed keeps rates high and growth slows, we could see a cascade of defaults that makes these shorts profitable. Conversely, if the economy remains resilient or the Fed cuts rates significantly (easing the pressure on borrowers), high-yield debt might rally, hurting a short position. It’s worth noting that **leveraged loans have outperformed recently** because their floating yields rose with rates, attracting yield-seeking investors ([Rising Loan Costs Are Hurting Riskier Companies | Live Index](https://liveindex.org/147611/2023/09/rising-loan-costs-are-hurting-riskier-companies/#:~:text=default%20rate%20for%20the%20past,rate%20debt)). A short seller would be countering this momentum, essentially wagering that the market is underestimating default risk going forward.

- **Shorting Private-Equity Linked Firms or Financial Institutions:** Another angle is shorting the **equity of private equity firms or lenders** that are deeply exposed to risky loans. For example, one might consider shorting publicly traded PE asset managers that manage highly levered portfolios or BDCs (business development companies) that lend to middle-market companies at floating rates. If defaults spike, these entities could see earnings declines or asset write-downs. However, this strategy is less direct and can be tricky – large PE firms are diversified and often have long-term fee structures that might buffer the immediate impact of portfolio losses. A more targeted approach might be identifying a **regional bank or insurer** with outsized CLO or leveraged loan holdings and shorting its stock or bonds. Research shows banks globally hold about 30% of CLOs (often the AAA tranches) and insurance companies and funds hold most of the rest ([Who Owns CLOs? Fed Research Sheds Some Light](https://www.garp.org/risk-intelligence/credit/who-owns-clos-fed-research-sheds-some-light#:~:text=The%20institutional,or%20other%20investment%20vehicles%209)) ([Who Owns CLOs? Fed Research Sheds Some Light](https://www.garp.org/risk-intelligence/credit/who-owns-clos-fed-research-sheds-some-light#:~:text=holdings%20of%20Cayman%20Islands,and%20funds%20or%20other)). If an institution has an unusual concentration in the lower tranches of CLOs or in junk loans, it could be vulnerable in a credit downturn. Shorting such an institution would be a bet that credit losses will dent its equity. Still, given that most mainstream banks and insurers have only moderate CLO exposure (and mainly high-grade), this is a niche play and requires careful due diligence.

In evaluating these short plays, investors should weigh the **downside risks**. Shorting can be risky if conditions change. For instance, a surprise rate-cut cycle could relieve pressure on borrowers, causing junk bond prices to rebound (leading to losses for shorts who bet on their decline). Likewise, an individual heavily shorted stock could become volatile – if a company manages a turnaround or finds a buyer/equity infusion, its stock might surge unexpectedly. Therefore, any short positions should be continually re-evaluated against the evolving economic backdrop. That said, the current climate of high interest rates, growing corporate debt distress, and cracks in structured credit markets **presents a fertile hunting ground for short sellers**. By using official filings, earnings reports, and credit analyses to identify over-leveraged firms, one can make informed short bets. The fates of Joann and Hooters underscore what can happen to companies that stretch themselves on adjustable debt: when the music stops, equity value can evaporate. A savvy investor may profit by anticipating these falls. As always, thorough research and timing are critical – but the economic signs suggest that more “short” opportunities will emerge if the corporate debt tide continues to go out.
