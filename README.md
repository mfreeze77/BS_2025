# Big Short 2025 Strategy

## Overview
This repository contains research and analysis for a high-upside "Big Short" investment strategy targeting sectors with extreme leverage, floating-rate debt exposure, and frothy valuations that appear underestimated by the market. The strategy draws inspiration from the original "Big Short" approach that identified underappreciated risks in mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis.

## Repository Contents

- **BS_2025_OV.md**: Comprehensive overview of the Big Short strategy, including target sectors, timeline, catalyst events, high-risk/high-reward opportunities, sophisticated trading approaches, and execution/risk management strategies.

- **BS_2025_Target.md**: Detailed analysis of distressed PE-backed companies, ETF and CLO exposure, shorting strategies for leverage risk, and systemic risk indicators.

- **JAF_BG.md**: Case study on Joann Fabrics and Hooters, examining how private equity ownership, debt structures, and rising interest rates contributed to their financial troubles. Includes analysis of floating-rate loans, CLO markets, pension fund exposure, and related short-selling opportunities.

- **JAF_BG_2.md**: Extended analysis of Joann Fabrics' and Hooters' financials before bankruptcy, the spike in PE-backed bankruptcies in 2024, the volume of floating-rate loans in PE deals, rising interest rates and default spikes, and CLO/pension fund exposure.

## Key Investment Thesis

The strategy identifies several vulnerable sectors where excessive leverage combined with rising interest rates creates potential shorting opportunities:

1. **Over-Leveraged Corporate Credit (Junk Bonds & Leveraged Loans)** - Companies with heavy debt loads and thin interest coverage ratios, particularly those with floating-rate debt exposure.

2. **Commercial Real Estate (CRE), Especially Offices** - Properties facing high leverage, secular headwinds (remote work), and looming debt refinancings at higher rates.

3. **Overhyped Equity Bubbles Tied to Cheap Money** - Stocks and sectors with unsustainable valuations that may crack in a higher-rate or consumer-weakened environment.

## Case Studies

The repository includes detailed case studies that illustrate the investment thesis:

- **Joann Fabrics**: Analysis of how a PE-backed retailer with over $1 billion in debt (much of it floating-rate) ultimately filed for bankruptcy despite having 96% of stores profitable at the store level.

- **Hooters**: Examination of how $300 million in securitized debt led to financial distress and bankruptcy preparations, even as the underlying business remained viable.

## Target Instruments

The research identifies several financial instruments that could be used to implement the strategy:

- Credit Default Swaps (CDS) on individual companies or indices
- Put options on high-yield bond ETFs (HYG, JNK) or loan ETFs (BKLN)
- Short positions on vulnerable equities or ETFs
- Targeted shorts on CLO mezzanine tranches
- CMBX indices for commercial real estate exposure

## Risk Factors

The strategy acknowledges several key risks:

- Timing risk (being too early, as with many "Big Short" trades)
- Negative carry costs (premiums paid while waiting for thesis to play out)
- Potential for central bank intervention or policy shifts
- Short squeeze risk in crowded trades
- Liquidity concerns in stressed market conditions
