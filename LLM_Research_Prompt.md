# Big Short 2025 Strategy: Advanced Research Prompt

## Project Context
You will be analyzing a comprehensive research project on the "Big Short 2025 Strategy" - an investment approach targeting sectors with extreme leverage, floating-rate debt exposure, and frothy valuations that appear underestimated by the market. The strategy draws inspiration from the original "Big Short" approach that identified underappreciated risks in mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis.

## Repository Structure
The GitHub repository contains several key documents:
- **BS_2025_OV.md**: Overview of the Big Short strategy, including target sectors, timeline, catalyst events, high-risk/high-reward opportunities, and risk management strategies.
- **BS_2025_Target.md**: Analysis of distressed PE-backed companies, ETF and CLO exposure, and systemic risk indicators.
- **JAF_BG.md** and **JAF_BG_2.md**: Case studies on Joann Fabrics and Hooters, examining how private equity ownership, debt structures, and rising interest rates contributed to their financial troubles.
- **README.md**: Overview of the repository and its contents.

## Research Objective
Expand and enhance the existing "Big Short 2025 Strategy" by incorporating critical 2025 macroeconomic variables that may accelerate or amplify the identified vulnerabilities in overleveraged companies. Your analysis should integrate these new variables with the existing research to create a more comprehensive and nuanced investment thesis.

## Key Variables to Incorporate

### 1. 2025 Tariff Environment
- Analyze the impact of current and proposed tariff policies on highly leveraged companies
- Identify sectors and companies most vulnerable to tariff-induced margin compression
- Examine how tariffs affect supply chains and input costs for PE-backed companies
- Quantify the potential "double whammy" effect of rising interest costs combined with tariff-related cost increases
- Assess which companies/sectors have the pricing power to pass on tariff costs versus those that must absorb them

### 2. Middle Class Spending Power Decline
- Analyze trends in middle-class discretionary spending capacity
- Identify which leveraged companies are most exposed to middle-class spending patterns
- Examine how wage growth compares to inflation in key consumer categories
- Assess the impact of student loan payments, housing costs, and healthcare expenses on consumer spending
- Develop metrics to identify companies with both high leverage and high exposure to middle-class consumers

### 3. Inflation-to-Income Ratio Analysis
- Develop a framework for measuring the gap between inflation and income growth across different consumer segments
- Analyze how this ratio has historically correlated with default rates and consumer spending
- Identify which sectors are most vulnerable to changes in this ratio
- Examine how companies with floating-rate debt are positioned to handle an environment where consumer incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation
- Create a scoring system that combines leverage metrics with exposure to inflation-sensitive consumers

### 4. Consumer Market Decline Indicators
- Analyze early warning signs of consumer retrenchment (credit card delinquencies, buy-now-pay-later defaults, etc.)
- Identify which PE-backed companies have business models most sensitive to consumer spending pullbacks
- Examine how consumer spending patterns are shifting and which leveraged companies are on the wrong side of these trends
- Assess the timing of potential consumer spending declines relative to debt maturity walls
- Develop a framework for monitoring consumer health metrics as leading indicators for the "Big Short" thesis

## Integration Requirements
Your analysis should:

1. **Maintain Consistency**: Integrate with the existing research framework while expanding its scope
2. **Provide Quantitative Rigor**: Develop specific metrics, thresholds, and screening criteria that incorporate the new variables
3. **Identify New Targets**: Highlight additional companies or sectors that become attractive short candidates when these new variables are considered
4. **Refine Timing**: Assess how these macroeconomic factors might accelerate or delay the timeline for the strategy
5. **Enhance Case Studies**: Apply the new variables to the existing Joann and Hooters case studies to demonstrate how they would have provided earlier warning signals
6. **Create Monitoring Framework**: Develop a dashboard of key indicators across all variables (leverage, interest rates, tariffs, consumer health) to track the thesis

## Deliverable Format
Produce a comprehensive research document that:

1. Summarizes the existing "Big Short 2025 Strategy" thesis
2. Introduces each new macroeconomic variable with supporting data and analysis
3. Demonstrates how these variables interact with and amplify the core thesis
4. Provides specific company examples that illustrate the combined impact
5. Offers a refined screening methodology incorporating all variables
6. Presents a monitoring framework for tracking the thesis over time
7. Concludes with specific actionable investment implications

## Analytical Approach
Your analysis should be:
- **Data-driven**: Utilize specific metrics and quantitative thresholds
- **Forward-looking**: Focus on predictive indicators rather than lagging ones
- **Nuanced**: Acknowledge counterarguments and potential mitigating factors
- **Practical**: Provide actionable insights that could inform investment decisions
- **Comprehensive**: Consider multiple scenarios and potential market reactions

This expanded research will transform the "Big Short 2025 Strategy" from a thesis primarily focused on leverage and interest rates to a comprehensive framework that captures the full spectrum of pressures facing vulnerable companies in today's complex economic environment.
